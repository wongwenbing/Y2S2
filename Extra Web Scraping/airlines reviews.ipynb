The only 2 negatives are the entertainment is on your phone and the movie selection and music selection is very limited (The movies are from 2022). So download your own movies to your phone. If you get the standard package, food and baggage does come with your purchase. With buying food (You do this when you buy your tickets online) was very confusing because they stated it was free but when you went on the website there was a yen amount. On our flight from LAX to Narita. We did not even get food even though we thought we got it. Unless you get the standard package, you cannot select your seats.

The service: Onboard staff were efficient and ready to help when needed; they came around often to collect rubbish and they were always smiling and helpful. 3) When things go wrong: My wife left her air pods on the plane and thought she'd never get them back. I wrote an email to Zip Air customer service and had an answer that day that they had found them. We picked them up on our return journey. The plane and seat: Relatively newish Boeing 787's and seats are brand new. Recline is OK. We were comfortable and thought for an LCC these were great. I’m 5’10 and had plenty of legroom. Food/Drink: We opted to bring our own and made sure to buy plenty of water after we cleared customs so can’t comment here. AV: We all had our own iPad’s/Headphones etc. so can’t comment here. In closing, if you read the terms and conditions of the carrier, understand that there is no food/drink unless you purchase it you really can’t go wrong booking Zip Air.

       "  'content': 'Not Verified |   I was pleasantly surprised with Zipair. The check-in process was smooth but as stated do arrive 3 hours early, because they do check the weight of your bag and your carry-on they are very strict with the weight. Zipair flights were a bit delayed but not by much less than 30 minutes. If you are flying out of LAX, LAX traffic sucks so be prepared, Park in the LAX economy lot and take a shuttle. The only 2 negatives are the entertainment is on your phone and the movie selection and music selection is very limited (The movies are from 2022). So download your own movies to your phone. If you get the standard package, food and baggage does come with your purchase. With buying food (You do this when you buy your tickets online) was very confusing because they stated it was free but when you went on the website there was a yen amount. On our flight from LAX to Narita. We did not even get food even though we thought we got it. Unless you get the standard package, you cannot select your seats. Like other airlines when there is an international flight throughout the flight, you will get snacks/water for free. Not on this airline. You must purchase it so recommend bringing a water bottle or at the airport eating a meal before boarding. The seats had standard legroom.',\n",

       "  'content': \"✅ Trip Verified | For the price and quality of service there is no better LCC than Zip Air. I went in with the lowest of expectations and safe to say Zip Air exceeded all of them. The cost: It cost us 70% less for a family of 4 (at the time of our booking) to fly Zip Air than the 3 major carriers who fly from Tokyo to Vancouver. The service: Onboard staff were efficient and ready to help when needed; they came around often to collect rubbish and they were always smiling and helpful. 3) When things go wrong: My wife left her air pods on the plane and thought she'd never get them back. I wrote an email to Zip Air customer service and had an answer that day that they had found them. We picked them up on our return journey. The plane and seat: Relatively newish Boeing 787's and seats are brand new. Recline is OK. We were comfortable and thought for an LCC these were great. I’m 5’10 and had plenty of legroom. Food/Drink: We opted to bring our own and made sure to buy plenty of water after we cleared customs so can’t comment here. AV: We all had our own iPad’s/Headphones etc. so can’t comment here. In closing, if you read the terms and conditions of the carrier, understand that there is no food/drink unless you purchase it you really can’t go wrong booking Zip Air. For the price point there is no better airline in my opinion. Other LCC’s should take note.\",\n",

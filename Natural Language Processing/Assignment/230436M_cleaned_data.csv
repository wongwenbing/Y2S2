142,152,"Understanding the genetic basis of convergence at broad phylogenetic scales remains a key challenge in biology. Kingfishers (Aves: Alcedinidae) are a cosmopolitan avian radiation with diverse colors, diets, and feeding behaviorsâ€”including the archetypal plunge-dive into water. Given the sensory and locomotor challenges associated with air-water transitions, kingfishers offer a powerful opportunity to explore the effects of convergent behaviors on the evolution of genomes and phenotypes, as well as direct comparisons between continental and island lineages. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing of 30 diverse kingfisher species to identify the genomic signatures associated with convergent feeding behaviors. We show that species with smaller ranges (i.e., on islands) have experienced stronger demographic fluctuations than those on continents, and that these differences have influenced the dynamics of molecular evolution. Comparative genomic analyses reveal positive selection and genomic convergence in brain and dietary genes in plunge-divers. These findings enhance our understanding of the connections between genotype and phenotype in a diverse avian radiation.

146,156,"In todayâ€™s environmental crisis, conservationists are increasingly confronted with terminally endangered species whose last few surviving populations may be affected by allelic introgression from closely related species. Yet there is a worrying lack of evidence-based recommendations and solutions for this emerging problem. We analyzed genome-wide DNA markers and plumage variability in a critically endangered insular songbird, the Black-winged Myna (BWM, Acridotheres melanopterus). This species is highly threatened by the illegal wildlife trade, with its wild population numbering in the low hundreds, and its continued survival urgently depending on ex-situ breeding. Its three subspecies occur along a geographic gradient of melanism and are variably interpreted as three species. However, our integrative approach revealed that melanism poorly reflects the pattern of limited genomic differentiation across BWM subspecies. We also uncovered allelic introgression into the most melanistic subspecies, tertius, from the all-black congeneric Javan Myna (A. javanicus), which is native to the same islands. Based on our results, we recommend the establishment of three separate breeding programs to maintain subspecific traits that may confer local adaptation, but with the option of occasional cross-breeding between insurance populations in order to boost genetic diversity and increase overall viability prospects of each breeding program. Our results underscore the importance of evidence-based integrative approaches when determining appropriate conservation units. Given the rapid increase of terminally endangered organisms in need of ex-situ conservation, this study provides an important blueprint for similar programs dealing with phenotypically variable species.",Javan Myna,1779,in todays environmental crisis conservationists are increasingly confronted with terminally endangered species whose last few surviving populations may be affected by allelic introgression from closely related species yet there is a worrying lack of evidencebased recommendations and solutions for this emerging problem we analyzed genomewide dna markers and plumage variability in a critically endangered insular songbird the blackwinged myna bwm acridotheres melanopterus this species is highly threatened by the illegal wildlife trade with its wild population numbering in the low hundreds and its continued survival urgently depending on exsitu breeding its three subspecies occur along a geographic gradient of melanism and are variably interpreted as three species however our integrative approach revealed that melanism poorly reflects the pattern of limited genomic differentiation across bwm subspecies we also uncovered allelic introgression into the most melanistic subspecies tertius from the allblack congeneric javan myna a javanicus which is native to the same islands based on our results we recommend the establishment of three separate breeding programs to maintain subspecific traits that may confer local adaptation but with the option of occasional crossbreeding between insurance populations in order to boost genetic diversity and increase overall viability prospects of each breeding program our results underscore the importance of evidencebased integrative approaches when determining appropriate conservation units given the rapid increase of terminally endangered organisms in need of exsitu conservation this study provides an important blueprint for similar programs dealing with phenotypically variable species

433,509,"The Javan myna (Acridotheres javanicus), - also known as the white-vented myna and the buffalo myna -, is a member of the Starling family.
	
	TAXONOMY
	The Javan myna is sometimes included in the great myna (Acridotheres grandis) or the jungle myna (A. fuscus). The International Ornithologists' Union recommends not using the name ""white-vented myna"" to avoid confusion. It is conspecific (of, or belonging to, the same species), and thought to be in competition with the Common Myna (A. tristis) in some of its range (e.g. India, Malaysia and Singapore).
	
	DESCRIPTION
	The Javan myna is predominantly black. The wings are brownish-black with a white wing patch, and the primaries have white bases. The undertail-coverts are white. It can raise the feathers on its forehead into a dramatic crest. The beak and legs are yellow. The eyes are lemon-yellow with a thick yellow eye ring. It sometimes has grey/ white flecking on its belly. The immature is browner. Its length is 21â€“23 cm (8.3â€“9.1 in). Its weight is about 100 g (3.5 oz).
	
	DISTRIBUTION AND HABITAT
	The Javan myna is native to Java and Bali and has been introduced to southeast Thailand, southern Malaysia, Singapore, Sumatra, the Lesser Sundas, Taiwan, Puerto Rico, and Japan. The Javan Myna is abundant in a variety of habitats. It is found in cities and cultivated areas. Javan mynas are as accomplished in cities as they are in padi fields, where they will prey on insects disturbed by water buffalo, often riding the buffalo like the related oxpecker. Especially in urban areas, they are considered a pest. They deposit droppings over buildings and even on unsuspecting human beings. Their roost also contaminates the ground below by the droppings. Apart from that, they are a source of noise pollution and are capable of spreading zoonoses. Singapore bans sale of this birds, only when it came from plantations.
	
	BEHAVIOUR
	The Javan myna is omnivorous and eats seeds, fruit, nectar, insects and human waste. It is often found in large groups and roosts in colonies. It builds its nest in holes. The eggs are bluish-glaucous. Javan mynas are bold and not very afraid of humans.
	
	CALL / VOCALIZATION
	The Javan Myna has an extremely liquid voice and, like the European starling, incorporates imitation into its repertoire (though it is not able to imitate the human voice, like the hill myna (Gracula religiosa)).

516,619,"The wildlife trade has facilitated the introduction of invasive non-native species, which may compete with native species for resources and alter ecosystems. Some of these species have great potential to become invasive if released or escaped from captivity. Here we studied the pet trade in a group of open countryside birds, the mynas (Acridotheres spp.) in Indonesia, and identified the areas that are at high risk of facing the establishment of these species. Mynas are among the most invasive birds in Southeast Asia. Once established in a new area, they are almost impossible to eradicate and can have strong negative impacts on the ecosystem. Preventing their introduction is therefore essential. Yet, invasive non-native mynas continue to be traded openly. We present data on the trade in seven species of mynas on Java, Bali and Lombok, with three species being native to parts of one or two of these islands, but not to the remainder, and four that are non-native to the region. From 2016 to 2021 we conducted 255 surveys of 30 animal markets. We recorded over 6000 mynas that were offered for sale outside their native range. Areas most at risk because of their high prevalence in specific animal markets, are Greater Jakarta, eastern Java, Bali and Lombok. The number of invasive non-native mynas recorded was positively related to the size of the animal market. Indonesia is signatory to several international agreements (CBD, ASEAN) that have policies and guidelines to prevent the introduction of invasive non-native species, but compliancy is weak. Annually hundreds and possibly thousands of invasive non-native mynas are released by Indonesian conservation authorities in regions that are outside their native range. Effective management of, and regulation of trade in, potential invasive non-native birds in Indonesia falls short and inadvertently greatly aids both their introduction and establishment.",Javan Myna,1922,the wildlife trade has facilitated the introduction of invasive nonnative species which may compete with native species for resources and alter ecosystems some of these species have great potential to become invasive if released or escaped from captivity here we studied the pet trade in a group of open countryside birds the mynas acridotheres spp in indonesia and identified the areas that are at high risk of facing the establishment of these species mynas are among the most invasive birds in southeast asia once established in a new area they are almost impossible to eradicate and can have strong negative impacts on the ecosystem preventing their introduction is therefore essential yet invasive nonnative mynas continue to be traded openly we present data on the trade in seven species of mynas on java bali and lombok with three species being native to parts of one or two of these islands but not to the remainder and four that are nonnative to the region fromtowe conductedsurveys ofanimal markets we recorded overmynas that were offered for sale outside their native range areas most at risk because of their high prevalence in specific animal markets are greater jakarta eastern java bali and lombok the number of invasive nonnative mynas recorded was positively related to the size of the animal market indonesia is signatory to several international agreements cbd asean that have policies and guidelines to prevent the introduction of invasive nonnative species but compliancy is weak annually hundreds and possibly thousands of invasive nonnative mynas are released by indonesian conservation authorities in regions that are outside their native range effective management of and regulation of trade in potential invasive nonnative birds in indonesia falls short and inadvertently greatly aids both their introduction and establishment

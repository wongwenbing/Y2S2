The Beatles,A Shot Of Rhythm And Blues,/b/beatles/a+shot+of+rhythm+blues_20014867.html,"Well, if your hands start a-clappin'  
And your fingers start a-poppin'  
And your feet start a-movin' around  
And if you start to swing and sway  
  
When the band starts to play  
A real cool way out sound  
And if you get to can't help it and you can't sit down  
You feel like you gotta move around  
  
You get a shot of rhythm and blues.  
With just a little rock and roll on the side  
Just for good measure.  
Get a pair of dancin' shoes  
  
Well, with your lover by your side  
Don't you know you're gonna have a rockin' time, see'mon!  
Don't you worry 'bout a thing  
If you start to dance and sing  
  
And chills come up on you  
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too  
Well, here's something for you to do  
  
Get a shot of rhythm and blues  
With just a little rock and roll on the side  
Just for good measure  
Get a pair of dancin' shoes  
  
Well, with your lover by your side  
Don't you know you're gonna have a rockin' time, see'mon!  
Don't you worry 'bout a thing  
If you start to dance and sing  
  
And chills come up on you  
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too  
Well, here's something for you to do  
  
Get a shot of rhythm and blues  
Get a pair of dancin' shoes  
Get a shot of rhythm and blues  
Well, with your lover by your side

The Beatles,Across The Universe,/b/beatles/across+the+universe_10026507.html,"Words are flowing out like  
Endless rain into a paper cup  
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.  
Pools of sorrow waves of joy  
Are drifting through my opened mind  
Possessing and caressing me.  
  
Jai Guru Deva. Om  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
  
Images of broken light, which  
Dance before me like a million eyes,  
They call me on and on across the universe.  
Thoughts meander like a  
Restless wind inside a letter box  
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.  
  
Jai Guru Deva. Om  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
  
Sounds of laughter, shades of life  
Are ringing through my opened ears  
Inciting and inviting me.  
Limitless undying love, which  
Shines around me like a million suns,  
It calls me on and on across the universe  
  
Jai Guru Deva, om.  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
  
Jai Guru Deva  x1
Jai Guru Deva  x2

And tenderly  
The kiss my lover brings  
She brings to me  
And I love her  
  
A love like ours  
Could never die

Bright are the stars that shine  
Dark is the sky  
I know this love of mine  
Will never die  
And I love her, ooh

And you bird is green  
But you can't see me  
You can't see me  
  
When your prized possessions  
Start to weigh you down  
Look in my direction  
I'll be round, I'll be round  
  
When your bird is broken  
Will it bring you down  
You may be awoken  
I'll be round, I'll be round  
  
You tell me that you've heard every sound there is  
And your bird can swing  
But you can't hear me  
You can't hear me

Another girl who will love me till the end  
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend

Far as the eye can see

Nothing that doesn't show

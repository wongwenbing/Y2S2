Several Wang Learning Centre students to quarantine after sharing class with student from Learning Point COVID-19 cluster,"Eleven students and a teacher from Wang Learning Centre have been required to quarantine after coming into contact with another student who recently tested positive for COVID-19.

The student had attended a class at Wang Learning Centre’s branch in East Coast on May 9.

The same student had also attended a class at Learning Point on May 8, the Chinese tuition centre told CNA on Saturday (May 15).

According to the Wang Learning Centre website, its East Coast branch is located at EastGate. The centre occupies several units on different floors in the building. 

Wang Learning Centre said it had scheduled a “full professional disinfection” on May 10, and that the Ministry of Health (MOH) had also asked them to identify the people who were in the same classroom as the COVID-19 positive student.

No other branches were affected, said Wang Learning Centre, which has eight outlets across Singapore.

Wang Learning Centre will move all classes online from May 16 to Jun 13 as part of enhanced measures.

The centre said other existing safety measures include SafeEntry check-in, temperature-taking, as well as mandatory mask-wearing. Surfaces are also disinfected during the 30-minute interval between classes.

“Teachers are not allowed to come to work if symptoms are spotted and are required to see a doctor immediately. We also hired professional disinfection services to disinfect our centres last weekend and this week,” they added.

MOH on Friday said that five COVID-19 cases, all of them students, have been linked to a previous case, a 50-year-old Singaporean woman who works as a tutor at Learning Point tuition centre at Parkway Centre.

All five students had attended the tutor's classes.

Among them are students from Kong Hwa School, St Stephen's School and St Andrew's Junior School. Some of the schools issued notices that they would conduct home-based learning after the detection of the cases.

Pre-school outdoor activities reduced to 2 children per group amid stricter COVID-19 measures,"Pre-schools will reduce the group size for outdoor activities to two children from the same class, down from five previously, as part of stricter COVID-19 safe management measures.

The changes will be in effect from May 16 to Jun 13, said the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) on Saturday (May 15).

The new measures come amid a spike in COVID-19 community cases in Singapore in recent weeks. The Government on Friday announced new temporary measures to stem the flow the rise in infections, including reducing the size of social gatherings to two a group and suspending dining-in at food and beverage outlets.

In line with the shift to Phase 2 (heightened alert), safe management measures at pre-schools and early Intervention centres will also be tightened, said ECDA on Saturday.

In addition to the curb on group sizes for outdoor activities at pre-schools, early intervention centres will also conduct their sessions in groups of two children during this period, said ECDA.

They can provide remote support to children who are unable to attend in-person services in the centre or have a lower level of support needs, said ECDA.

SUPPLEMENTARY PROGRAMMES

Additionally, individuals conducting supplementary programmes can also now only physically serve one pre-school. They were previously allowed to serve a maximum of four schools.

This applies to those who provide enrichment programmes, Focused Language Assistance in Reading and Development Support and Learning Support.

Exceptions will be made for providers of the Development Support Plus programme, which serves children with higher developmental needs. These providers can serve up to four places of practice at a time.

NO PARENTS ALLOWED

During this period, admission of external visitors will be restricted to people who are needed to support centre operations, such as for urgent repairs, or perform necessary functions like licensing and auditing. They will be subject to strict safe management measures.

All parents - including those of newly enrolled children - will not be allowed to enter pre-schools.

From Sunday, all staff must also wear masks in pre-schools. They will not be allowed to use face shields alone without a mask when conducting lessons.

Face shields instead of masks were allowed for people speaking to a group in a classroom or lecture-style setting under Ministry of Health guidelines announced last June.

Pre-schools will continue to segregate children by their classes and suspend large group activities in pre-schools and activities in external venues, said ECDA.

All staff at pre-schools and early intervention centres will be restricted to serve only one centre. Child first-aid training must now also be conducted virtually along with all other external training.

Parents are encouraged to monitor the health of their children, seek medical attention promptly and not bring their children to the preschools or (early intervention) centres if their children feel unwell, said ECDA.

Staff are likewise encouraged to seek medical attention promptly if unwell.

Seventeen of Saturday's new community cases were linked to previous clusters, of which 11 had already been placed on quarantine earlier. Two cases are unlinked. 

The remaining 12 cases were imported and were placed on stay-home notice upon their arrival in Singapore, said the ministry in its preliminary daily update. Of these, seven are returning Singaporeans or permanent residents. 

No new infections were reported in foreign workers' dormitories.

Details of the new cases will be released on Saturday night, MOH said.

Changi Airport will segregate flights and passengers from high-risk countries and regions from those arriving from low-risk places, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said on Saturday.

Flights arriving from high-risk regions will be assigned different piers. Passengers on these flights will use different arrival immigration halls, baggage belts and toilets from those arriving on flights from low-risk countries or regions.

Passengers on flights from very high-risk countries will be escorted through the airport and have their on-arrival COVID-19 tests done at separate health screening stations.

The move comes after about 20 cases in the cluster of infections at the airport were found to have been quite congregated around an area that receives travellers from higher-risk regions.

About 5,000 inmates, staff and partners at Changi Prison will be tested for COVID-19 over the next few days, after a cook working there was confirmed to have the infection.

Face-to-face visits and tele-visits for inmates of Changi Prison will also be replaced by phone calls with effect from Monday until further notice.

As of Saturday, Singapore has reported a total of 61,536 COVID-19 cases and 31 fatalities from the disease.

Pre-event testing to be subsidised for live performances amid tightened COVID-19 measures,"The Government will subsidise COVID-19 pre-event testing for arts and culture companies that put on permitted live performances during the period of tightened measures from May 16 to Jun 13.

This will enable larger audiences to attend live performances safely, cushioning the financial impact to arts companies, said the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) on Saturday (May 15).
AdvertisementAdvertisement
All indoor and outdoor live performances should be deferred during the period of tightened measures, said MCCY.

However, live performances that were publicised before May 5 and are scheduled to take place from May 8 to Jun 13 may proceed with approval from the Ministry of Trade and Industry.

From May 16, audiences are capped at 100 people with pre-event testing, and 50 people without pre-event testing.

All performers must be properly masked on stage. Singing or playing of instruments that require intentional expulsion of air, such as wind and brass instruments, are not allowed.

MCCY said it will also provide further support for self-employed people in the arts and culture sector affected by the latest measures.

The Arts and Resilience Package has been topped up over the past year to reach the current S$75 million, the ministry noted.

This amount funds operating grants, venue hire subsidies, assistance to self-employed people and assistance to support business transformation, it said.

SPORTS ACTIVITIES

MCCY also clarified what the tightened measures mean for other types of activities under its sectors.

For indoor and outdoor sports facilities, the capacity limit has been amended to one person per 16 sq m, or 50 people, whichever is lower.

In indoor facilities, only non-strenuous activities can continue and participants must be masked at all times.

Activities which will result in participants lowering their masks to catch a breath will not be permitted, said MCCY.

Sharing of common equipment is not allowed indoors to reduce fomite transmission.

For outdoor facilities, people engaging in strenuous exercise can do so in groups of up to two people, including any instructor.

They must keep 2m apart. They can be unmasked when exerting themselves, but should put on their masks thereafter.

Group classes held indoors and outdoors are capped at 30 people including the instructor, or the venue capacity limit, whichever is lower.

All instructors and participants must remain masked at all times. Participants must be in groups of no more than two, with 2m between individuals, and 3m between groups.

Outdoor classes for strenuous activities that require participants to be unmasked will be capped at two people including the instructor.

SportSG's relief measures for businesses and self-employed people will be extended from May 30 to cover the heightened alert period up to Jun 13.

SportSG is also looking at providing more outdoor spaces in its ActiveSG facilities for classes, said MCCY.

WORSHIP SERVICES

Congregational and other worship services will be limited to 100 people with pre-event testing or up to 50 people at a time without pre-event testing, subject to safe management measures and venue capacity limits.

Religious workers supporting these services should be kept to a minimum, added MCCY.

Worshippers can participate in worship services in groups of no more than two people.

Masks must be worn at all times by everyone, including when speaking during congregational and other worship services. Face shields are not permitted substitutes for proper face masks.

Singing and playing of wind or brass instruments will not be allowed, and there should also be no sharing of prayer or common items.

Religious organisations can continue to use places of worship to conduct religious rites in groups of no more than two people.

All other religious activities, such as religious classes for adults and children, will be suspended, said MCCY.

WEDDINGS AND FUNERALS

Wedding solemnisations can continue with up to 100 people without pre-event testing or up to 50 people without pre-event testing, subject to venue capacity limits.

These limits exclude the solemniser and religious and supporting workers, whose numbers should be kept to a minimum, said MCCY.

Wedding receptions will not be allowed, in line with curbs on dining-in.

Funerals, wakes, burials, cremations, installations of niches and post-funeral rites at places of worship can involve not more than 20 attendees at any time, subject to venue capacity limits.

This limit excludes religious and supporting workers, whose numbers should be kept to a minimum, said MCCY.

Attendees should be organised in groups of no more than two people and must maintain safe distancing and be masked at all times.

DIGITAL PRODUCTIONS AND REHEARSALS

For both arts companies and religious organisations, recording of digital productions and their rehearsals are limited to 15 performers and crew members on stage and backstage at any given time.

This includes a maximum of 10 unmasked performers, of whom no more than two people can sing or play wind or brass instruments.

Arts and cultural organisations must notify the National Arts Council while religious organisations must notify MCCY before proceeding with their digital productions.

ARTS AND CULTURE CLASSES

All speakers, participants and instructors in arts and culture classes, lectures, talks and workshops must be properly masked at all times.

Activities that cannot be conducted with masks on must be suspended.

There are to be no classes in singing and wind or brass instruments even if masked, said MCCY, adding that face shields are not permitted substitutes for masks.

MUSEUM VISITS

Arts and heritage venues such as museums can continue operations, but at a reduced capacity of 25 per cent.

Tours in museum premises can be conducted for a maximum group size of 20 people excluding the guide.

A maximum of two people is allowed in any one sub-group, with all other prevailing safe management measures in place, such as social distancing.

It is critical that our people, businesses and Government work together to bring down the number of COVID-19 cases, to keep our community safe, said MCCY.

MCCY understands that the tightened measures are disruptive to our sectors and have developed support packages to help our stakeholders make the necessary adjustments.

MCCY very much appreciates our religious organisations, as well as our arts, culture, and sports businesses and communities for rallying together to implement the safe management measures. Together, we will emerge safe, and stronger.

"COVID-19: Changi Airport to segregate flight arrivals from high-risk countries, regions","Changi Airport will segregate flights and passengers from high-risk countries and regions from those arriving from low-risk places, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said on Saturday (May 15).

Flights arriving from high-risk regions will be assigned different piers. Passengers on these flights will use different arrival immigration halls, baggage belts and toilets from those arriving on flights from low-risk countries or regions.

Passengers on flights from very high-risk countries will be escorted through the airport and have their on-arrival COVID-19 tests done at separate health screening stations.

“This will reduce the degree of interaction with other passengers and staff,” CAAS said in a media release.

CNA has contacted the aviation authority on which countries and regions are classified as high risk or very high risk. 

The move comes after it was discovered that about 20 cases in the cluster of infections at the airport had been “quite congregated” around an area that receives travellers from higher-risk regions.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
Speaking at a multi-ministry task force press conference on Friday, Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung said: “This is the zone with a finger pier that receives higher-risk country arrivals, including (from) South Asia, and then the conveyor belt and immigration.

“And from that zone, workers go have their lunch, go have their meals at the Terminal 3 Basement 2 commercial areas and the food court, and we suspect from there, it transmitted to members of the public that visited the place.”

Singapore has suspended entry to long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with recent travel history to India since Apr 24. This includes those who transit in India.

Those with recent travel history to Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have also been barred from entering or transiting in Singapore since May 2. 

The cluster at Changi Airport has now grown to a total of 59 cases - Singapore's largest active cluster. The first detected case in this cluster is an 88-year-old cleaner with Ramky Cleantech Services who was confirmed to have COVID-19 on May 5.

Of the 59 infections in the cluster, 35 are airport workers.

“None of the cases are in serious condition, require oxygen or are in the intensive care unit,” CAAS said.

ENHANCED PROTECTION FOR AIRPORT WORKERS

CAAS said that additional measures will be taken to further protect airport workers.

“We are putting in place cohorting arrangements to reduce the risk of airport workers becoming infected,” the authority said.

“Different groups of airport workers will have separate rest areas, and work teams will be ringfenced from other work teams. Those working in higher-risk areas will have their meals delivered to them.”

A special COVID-19 testing operation for airport workers has been under way since May 9, with all workers in Terminals 1 and 3, as well as Jewel Changi Airport, required to take tests. Terminal 2 has been closed since May 1, 2020.

Close to 10,000 workers have been tested so far, with the vast majority of tests coming back negative, CAAS said.

The testing operation will be extended to cover office workers in Changi Airport passenger terminal buildings, with about 8,000 workers to be tested in the coming days.

“Subsequently, all airport workers in higher-risk roles will be placed on a seven-day rostered routine testing cycle, regardless of their vaccination status,” CAAS said.

“This is a step-up from the current 14-day cycle.”

To date, 90 per cent of frontline aviation workers have been vaccinated against COVID-19. CAAS said operations are being stepped up to vaccinate the remaining 10 per cent, as well as other essential aviation workers.

CLEANING AND DISINFECTION ONGOING

The cleaning and disinfection of the Kopitiam and NTUC FairPrice outlets at Terminal 3's Basement 2 have been completed, and the outlets’ hygiene practices and safe management measures are currently being reviewed.

“Cleaning and disinfection are also ongoing at Jewel Changi Airport,” CAAS said.

In addition, we will extend cleaning and disinfection operations to the transit areas, in particular, those areas where airport workers were suspected to have been infected.”

Changi Airport’s passenger terminal buildings and Jewel are closed to the public until May 27.

FREE TESTING FOR VISITORS

On Wednesday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said it will offer free testing for members of the public who visited Terminal 3 from May 3 onwards. It later extended the free testing to those who visited the terminal from May 1.

MOH will progressively inform these individuals via SMS notification with information on how to book an appointment for their test, CAAS said.

MOH has also advised those who visited Terminal 1 and Jewel from May 1 onwards to monitor their health closely for 14 days from their date of visit and see a doctor if they are unwell.

They are strongly encouraged to visit a regional screening centre or Swab and Send Home Public Health Preparedness Clinic for a free COVID-19 test if they feel unwell, the ministry said.

"Maris Stella High School gate to be rebuilt, says HDB in response to petition to preserve the gate","In response to a petition to preserve the Maris Stella High School (MSHS) gate, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) said on Saturday (May 15) that the gate cannot be preserved but will be rebuilt within the school compound.

The school gate, built in 1997, is along Mount Vernon Road, which needs to be widened for residents of the upcoming homes in Bidadari estate and to improve traffic flow, said HDB.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
To do this, we need to acquire part of the driveway into MSHS’s compound and remove the gate from its current location, said HDB in a statement on Facebook on Saturday.

When school alumni, students and their parents heard about this last week, many were dismayed. Mr Harold Yeo, whose son attends the school, started a petition to preserve the gate.

More than 5,000 people have signed Mr Yeo's petition as of Saturday noon.

Maris Stella High School was founded in 1958 and moved to its current Mount Vernon site in 1966. The Catholic boys' school is known for its strong bilingual programme and counts among its alumni Health Minister Ong Ye Kung and Senior Minister of State for Manpower and for Health Koh Poh Koon.

One old boy, who went to the school from pre-school to Secondary 4, told CNA that he hopes the gate can be retained.

It's so beautifully done with its Oriental design, it's really a pity to take it down. There should be some physical aspect to remember our history by, said Mr Jeremiah Tan, whose two sons also attended Maris Stella. 

HDB said it had started discussing the matter with the school since August 2018, and various options were explored.

One option was to relocate the existing gate to a suitable site within the school, but consultants assessed that this was not technically feasible, and the structure could be damaged during the relocation. 

Instead, HDB, the school owners and Marist Brothers agreed that a new arch gate would be built within the school compound, said HDB. The new gate would incorporate as much of the elements of the existing gate as possible, including the distinctive blue tiles on the arch roof.

The Marist Brothers is a religious order that founded and runs the school.

HDB said that the school’s alumni association has also offered its assistance. 

They will develop a digital replica of the design of the existing gate, to make it easier to construct a new gate that resembles the existing one, it said. 

We will continue to work with the school and the alumni association on the design and construction of the new gate within the school compound. 

We are also studying if other physical elements, such as the signage of the school on the existing arch gate, can be retained along with the distinctive blue tiles in the final design of the new rebuilt gate.

The existing gate will not be removed until the new gate is constructed, estimated in end-2021, HDB added.

When contacted by CNA, Mr Yeo said: Yes, that is what we are hoping for.

Mr Tan Kiat How, the Minister of State for Communications and Information, and for National Development, said HDB is very mindful of what the gate means to the school and its students.

Even though the gate was only installed in 1997, it has since become an endearing emblem of the school that the boys are proud of, he wrote.

He added that they spoke to Maris Stella alumni president Chris Lee on Friday who shared with them the views of the students and alumni.

The new Maris Stella gate will retain its original look and retrofitted with key portions of the old gate, he said on Facebook.

HDB intends to incorporate as much of the old gate into the new, such as the iconic blue tiles and possibly the plaque that carries the school’s name."
Each PAP town council to have sustainability committee with dedicated sustainability officer as part of efforts to go green,"SINGAPORE: Each People's Action Party (PAP) town council will have a sustainability committee with a dedicated sustainability officer to drive implementation of green efforts, the party announced on Saturday (May 15).

This will be part of the Action for Green Towns initiative, which will see all of the PAP's 15 town councils collaborate in order to improve sustainability practices within their communities, the party said in a press release.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
The initiative aims to galvanise various stakeholders to work towards making every PAP-managed town zero waste, energy efficient and greener by 2025, added PAP.

As part of the initiative, each PAP town council will also have a Member of Parliament (MP) as a sustainability champion.

These 15 individuals, together with Young PAP representatives, will form the Action for Green Towns task force led by chairperson of Jalan Besar Town Council Dr Wan Rizal.

The task force will also draw on the expertise of sustainability experts and advocates in the industry, non-governmental organisations and civil society to advise and help generate ideas to maximise participation and inclusion, said the PAP.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
We will study what is being done locally and abroad and formulate a sustainability roadmap for all PAP Town Councils to apply in their town management. There will be many ways for everyone to come on board and get involved meaningfully, said Dr Wan Rizal.

We believe our residents do not just want to be proud of the estates they live in, but also of their contributions to making Singapore a bright green spark in the world.

To begin with, the task force will review all existing sustainability projects across the different town councils and share best practices, said the PAP.

Some of these initiatives include sustainable energy initiatives, water-saving initiatives, sustainable transport initiatives and food composting.
Advertisement
The task force will unveil more details of its plans by the end of the year.

Each sustainability committee will lead and facilitate efforts with all stakeholders in the respective town, said the PAP.

Residents will play a key role in shaping this green journey for their towns and they will be involved in the entire process from feedback and ideation to implementation, the party noted.

Speaking at a virtual press conference on Saturday, Mr Lim Biow Chuan, the coordinating chairperson for the PAP town councils, noted that MPs have been asked to be sustainability champions as the party wants to stress the importance and significance of sustainability efforts.

Having (an) MP champion the efforts of sustainability is really our signal that we take this sustainability movement very seriously, he added.

These MPs will also be involved in their town council's sustainability committee, added Dr Rizal.

When it comes to potential costs that these green initiatives may incur, Mr Lim said that this was something that will be considered.

Town councils are funded largely by service and conservancy fees, and also (the) Government does give funding to all town councils. So we would explore the various recommendations that would come from (Dr) Wan Rizal's committee, before deciding how to fund these initiatives.

The PAP noted that all of its town councils are enhancing their sustainability plans and efforts in support of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, and aim to transform housing estates into better living environments for every resident.

This builds on the Party's recent sustainability motion in Parliament, put together by the Government Parliamentary Committee for Sustainability and the Environment and Young PAP, said the party.

The impact of climate change cannot be ignored and we need to take action to ensure that we are creating a better and more sustainable living environment for all our residents.

This is important to address a global emergency and that is why sustainability must be a cornerstone of our town management practices, said Mr Lim.

I believe that we can truly make a positive difference in our estates, as we walk the talk to embrace a greener way of life with everyone."
"About 5,000 inmates, staff to be tested for COVID-19 after cook at Changi Prison tests positive","About 5,000 inmates, staff and partners at Changi Prison will be tested for COVID-19 over the next few days after a cook working there was confirmed to have the infection.

All inmates' face-to-face visits and tele-visits will also be replaced by phone calls with effect from May 17 until further notice, the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) said on Saturday (May 15).
AdvertisementAdvertisement
The cook who is a confirmed case is a contract staff working in the prison kitchen located at Institution A5 in Cluster A of Changi Prison, said SPS. He is employed by SATS Food Services.

The man, known as Case 63160, was reported as an unlinked community case by the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Friday. He is fully vaccinated.

The 39-year-old last reported to work on Wednesday. He felt unwell after work, developing a fever and runny nose, and sought medical treatment at a general practitioner clinic where he received a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19. His test result came back positive the next day.

AdvertisementAdvertisement
SPS said it immediately ceased kitchen operations at Institution A5 and started contact tracing among staff and inmates upon confirmation of his infection.

All close contacts of the man have been isolated or placed in quarantine pending issuance of a quarantine order, said the service.

Affected inmates will serve their quarantine orders in prison, isolated from the rest of the inmate population. Staff, vendors and volunteers will serve theirs at MOH's designated quarantine facility.

TESTING FOR CLUSTER A
Advertisement
As a precautionary measure, activities including family visits, counselling sessions and non-critical hospital appointments have been halted in Institution A5 where the cook worked, said SPS.

All affected areas have also been thoroughly cleaned and disinfected.

PCR testing has started for all inmates, staff, vendors and volunteers who have been to Institution A5 from Monday to Wednesday. About 1,050 inmates, staff and partners will be tested, said SPS.

The Changi Prison complex comprises two clusters, Cluster A and Cluster B, each of which contains five institutions. Cluster A comprises Institutions A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5.

SPS said it will take a highly precautionary measure to test all inmates, staff and partners from Cluster A while the test results for those placed on quarantine order are pending.

This is to ensure that the virus does not spread undetected within prisons, and that any asymptomatic cases are promptly identified and isolated, said the service.

About 5,000 people will be progressively tested over the next few days.

Inmate activities including rehabilitation programmes will be suspended to facilitate the testing, said SPS.

NO FACE-TO-FACE OR TELE-VISITS

In view of the tighter measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 community transmission, there will be no face-to-face visits and tele-visits for all inmates from May 17 until further notice. These will be replaced with phone calls, said SPS.

The measures are implemented from May 17 as face-to-face visits and tele-visits do not take place on Sundays, said the service.

Families who have already booked their visits will have them automatically converted to phone calls. Inmates can also continue to communicate with their families through e-letters.

SPS has also suspended all rehabilitation programmes conducted by vendors and volunteers during this period.

These are important, preventive steps taken by SPS, for the safety of our inmates and their families, staff and partners, and they complement existing measures that have been in place since the onset of COVID-19, said the service.

SPS said it has also increased the duration of cohort segregation for newly admitted inmates from 14 to 21 days, since May 8.

Newly admitted inmates will undergo PCR tests upon admission, as well as on the 14th and 20th day of segregation, it said.

They are allowed to join the general inmate population after testing negative at the end of the cohort segregation period.

Commentary: Booster shot for COVID-19: Not everyone needs it,"Within just 18 months of the first COVID-19 case being reported in Wuhan, more than 1.25 billion vaccine doses have been administered in 174 countries so far, roughly averaging 19.4 million doses a day – the equivalent of vaccinating more than three times the population of Singapore, daily. 

Some countries like Israel, the United States and the United Kingdom (UK) lead the charge. Two-thirds of UK’s population has received the first dose so far and nearly a third have received both doses. 
AdvertisementAdvertisement
Singapore’s ramping up too, with 1.2 million people, or about 20 per cent of the population, completing the full vaccine regimen and 1.8 million people receiving at least one vaccine shot as of May 9, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong revealed in Parliament on Tuesday (May 11).

Unless we can accelerate the rollout of vaccines, it should come as no surprise that at current vaccination rates, it could be several years before the world achieves herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2. 

The world marches out of COVID-19 at the pace of the slowest nation. So, the World Health Organization (WHO) has rightly emphasised the need for international cooperation in vaccination campaigns because a global pandemic requires global efforts to end it.

THE SPREAD OF NEW VARIANTS

With countries at different stages of their vaccination programmes and a few yet to begin, we face significant challenges in trying to protect the world’s population from this infection.

As the coronavirus continues to circulate, infecting people who have not yet been vaccinated, mutants can spread and more variants are likely to develop. Some of these variants could even challenge the immunity provided by vaccines widely deployed in other countries. 

Mutations are intrinsic to viruses - they occur because viruses are constantly replicating, making copies of themselves. They inherently introduce errors, making their progeny different, helping the viruses to mutate and spread more effectively. 
Advertisement
In just over a year since the virus was formally identified, there are now thousands of genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 circulating across the world. Most of these mutations are insignificant. Some may even limit the virus, but successful mutants make it more transmissible or evade existing immune mechanisms.

The UK, South Africa, Brazil and India variants are notably differentiated by changes to their spike protein - the part of the virus which attaches to receptors on human cells and gains entry inside. This is the target for most of the world's vaccines.

The UK strain is about 70 per cent more infectious, while the India, South Africa and Brazil variants have mutations that increase transmissibility and evade previous immunity. Tracking these existing or new variants are of paramount importance. It helps predict new waves of infection allowing resource planning.

Our knowledge about these variants therefore needs to be constantly updated. Last week, Public Health England declared that a variant first identified in India – known as B16172 - is a “variant of concern” due to evidence of greater transmissibility. 

Weeks earlier, the Indian consortium INSACOG had flagged the possibility of a surge in infections, even before India was hit by a second wave of COVID-19. 

Success in tracking variants largely depends on our ability to detect the early signs of their emergence in communities which is difficult in large populations, especially if they’re spread out over expansive geographies. Real-time knowledge sharing between trans-national scientific networks is critical to keep up with the mutations.

Beyond governments, collaborations between industry, academic and scientific institutions will prove crucial in setting up an early warning system. 

For instance, about a year into this pandemic, healthcare company Abbott activated a first-of-its-kind global scientific network, collaborating with leading institutions in North America, South America, Africa and Asia, to detect and rapidly respond to current and future pandemic threats. 

SUPPRESSING THE VARIANTS’ SPREAD

The variants’ rapid advance in recent weeks, across some countries, underscores the importance of wearing masks, safe distancing and practicing good hand hygiene in suppressing their spread, even in the face of a successful vaccination programme.

These public health measures form our first line of defence against the development of new mutations and critically, they can help buy us time to roll-out vaccination programmes across the world.

Currently approved vaccines offer a significant degree of protection against variants. Early scientific data suggests development of some herd immunity. Even in vaccine failures - individuals who fall sick with detectable virus after vaccination - there was no reported secondary spread, albeit in a small group of 22 vaccinated people in Chicago.

As more and more people are vaccinated or recover from a SARS-CoV-2 infection, our collective immunity rises. However, the verdict on the effectiveness of each vaccine to defend against the variants differs and remains wide open.

As the variants spread and new mutations emerge, scientists have expressed confidence that they can deploy, and even re-engineer, existing vaccines to better tackle them.

Vaccine makers such as Pfizer and Moderna have indicated that people may need a third dose after a few months, or receive a booster shot periodically, to help maintain immunity. 

This creates a dilemma in the immediate term – whether vaccine suppliers should focus on protecting people who have not yet been vaccinated or giving a booster shot to those who have already been vaccinated. Vaccinating as many people as possible should always be our top priority because some protection is better than none. 

WHO GETS THE VACCINE?

There are options however to manage these trade-offs. 

With global demand for vaccines far outstripping supply, lifting intellectual property protections would boost vaccine availability and remove barriers to equitable access. That said, making vaccines is a complex endeavour. Increasing supply will take some months, if not years, even if vaccines are produced at warp speed. 

German bio-tech company BioNTech announced on Monday (May 10) it is setting up a manufacturing plant in Singapore to produce vaccines for Southeast Asia, but the facility will not be operational until 2023.

But we don’t have to despair as there’s another option. Until supplies can be ramped up, another tool that could be used to boost vaccine access, to some degree, is quantitative antibody testing. 

Antibodies are infection-fighting proteins produced to defend against a viral attack, while vaccines trigger the creation of antibodies. 

There are several types of antibodies but simplistically, the quantity and presence of some specific antibodies in the body can help doctors determine the level of immunity provided by a vaccine. 

The level of immune response generated by the vaccine or the virus may be different in different people with different immunity.

Quantitative antibody tests, made by diagnostic companies such as Siemens, Abbott and Roche are specifically designed to detect the presence of these particular antibodies that can help determine a person’s level of immunity. 

Whereas the Singapore-developed cPass test can detect whether a person has neutralising antibodies which can prevent the coronavirus from infecting a patient's cells.

The key is that these antibody tests can measure immune response and provide insights for doctors to understand how an individual can cope with a potential coronavirus infection.

Antibody testing therefore has great value in helping to prioritise people who need the third dose the most by identifying those with low levels of immunity. 

Admittedly, these simple tests do not measure other defence cells such as T cells which could also kick-in and provide protection. Such tests are laborious and difficult to interpret and are usually left in the realms of research.

By prioritising who receives the third booster shot, we can ensure that no dose of the vaccine is unnecessarily administered to a person who may have adequate immunity.

This would minimise the need to administer the booster en masse, freeing up critical infrastructure and resources, and helping to achieve greater vaccine equity. This could become a key tool in helping the world achieve herd immunity faster by deploying vaccines where they are most needed.

Judicious antibody testing can therefore be an able ally in the race to vaccinate the world. With every additional person that’s vaccinated earlier, the playground for the virus shrinks, inch by inch.

IN FOCUS: Tackling COVID-19 with targeted measures - the new normal for Singapore?,"It had been a tough year for Singapore.

Then, as 2020 came to its close, it looked like the country could see a flicker of light at the end of the long COVID-19 tunnel with its transition on Dec 28 to Phase 3 of its reopening.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
And in the months that followed, the path to a post-pandemic normality looked to be fairly smooth, with community cases generally running to no more than a few a day. 

Plans for events which hadn't been possible for months started to gather pace. This was in spite of the pandemic continuing to rage worldwide, with a number of countries forced to introduce and then reintroduce measures to curb the spread of the raging virus.

Singapore hadn't needed to. 

Then, very quickly, things changed. Clusters began to spring up, with one emerging at Tan Tock Seng Hospital - the first in a local hospital since the pandemic began. Community cases began to steadily increase.

To tackle the spike, Singapore announced some tighter, targeted measures on May 4. 

Places that were considered high-risk, such as indoor gyms and fitness studios, were instructed to close unless they offered low-intensity activities, while fewer people would be allowed at attractions, public libraries, funerals and MICE events. 

Limits for gatherings reverted to five people.

But as community cases showed no signs of letting up, measures were further tightened on Friday (May 14) under what the Health Ministry called Phase 2 (Heightened Alert).
Advertisement
Among other initiatives, sizes of group gatherings were further reduced from five to two people, with dining-in at F&B establishments banned. Working from home is also to be the default at workplaces.

The new measures will take effect from May 16 through June 13.

Speaking at a multi-ministry task force press conference on Friday, Education Minister Lawrence Wong noted in particular that “risk settings” for the spread of the virus were indoor environments where people do not put a mask on.

This is why the Government had focused on tightening restrictions in such areas, he noted.

“We have already done so earlier for activities in the gyms and fitness centers where you are unable to keep your mask on,” Mr Wong explained.

“And now the next step ... is to restrict such activities in F&B establishments, and therefore no more dining in. In other settings - outdoors or when you are in a space but you are able to keep your mask on - we believe with safe distancing, with proper precautions, and safeguards, these activities can still continue.”

Health Minister Gan Kim Yong also added that such moves would be part of Singapore’s “journey to recovery”.

“This is part of a journey to recovery, because every now and then, when there's (an) outbreak, we have to review our measures, and we need to tighten as we go along. And when infections come under control, then we’ll have (the) opportunity to roll back some of these measures, open up the economy, open up the community, so that people can begin to also socialise and interact with one another.”

BREAKING THE CHAINS OF TRANSMISSION

As the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve globally, infectious disease experts say that targeted sectoral measures, such as the ones introduced by Singapore, are set to be the way forward.

“Sectoral lockdowns in a targeted fashion (are) likely the way to go, but the thing is that the decision to do that must be quick and fast,” said Dr Ling Li Min, who is an infectious disease specialist at Rophi Clinic.

Dr Ling noted that such an approach requires that community cases are not widespread.

“When countries embark on these targeted measures, it is probably at a point in time whereby they feel that they can still control it, meaning that community cases are not widespread, it's only small clusters here and there,” she explained. 

“Early on, you can't keep waiting for the cases to increase, and that can only happen when the community cases overall are still low. If there are a lot of community cases, then your sectoral lockdown isn’t going to work.”

For such measures to bear fruit, the rest of the community must be “clued in”, said Dr Ling.

“The testing, the tracing, (the) isolation must be superb and robust. Some of these countries don't quite have that - they're not as swift with that,” she noted.

Dr Paul Tambyah, infectious diseases expert and president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, noted that these sectoral measures are likely to remain in place until vaccination rates reach higher levels.

“I think that these measures are temporary until the vaccination rates reach levels that have been achieved in countries such as Israel where the measures are being lifted gradually,” he said.

“Similar opening up is occurring in other highly vaccinated places such as the UK and US and UAE. If the WTO (World Trade Organisation) waiver on vaccine patents is granted, then this is likely to happen sooner rather than later all over the world.”

As Singapore is one of the world’s most globally connected cities, it is likely to need “far higher” levels of vaccination to protect the population than other more closed or isolated societies such as Israel or New Zealand, added Dr Tambyah.

As of May 9, about 1.8 million people had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, with 1.2 million of them receiving their second dose, Mr Gan had said in Parliament on Tuesday (May 11).

Data compiled by the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford, shows that close to 60 percent of Israel’s population has received at least one dose of the vaccine. The number currently stands at about 30 per cent for Singapore.

FINDING ‘MIDDLE GROUND’

One of the reasons why total lockdowns have been implemented in some countries is due to the fact that hospitals are facing the possibility of being inundated, said Dr Teo Yik Ying, who is dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.

“A total lockdown is necessary when the health system is at risk of being overwhelmed. That is when you realize that the situation is getting rapidly out of control. And the definition of out of control here is that the infection is spreading so fast in the community, and resulting in a large number of people entering the hospitals,” said Dr Teo.

A total lockdown would serve two main purposes, he noted. The first of which would be to stop interaction so as to cut chains of transmission in the community. 

And when such chains are cut, this minimises the infections only to households, he added.

“What that means is that with time, you actually allow the number of patients in the hospitals to slowly go down ... Your hospitals now have a chance to breathe,” he said.

“That is actually very important because once your hospital is overwhelmed, you realise that anyone seeking care at the hospital, whether it is COVID, or non COVID related, they will be compromised because nurses are overwhelmed, doctors are overwhelmed.” 

And while Singapore had been forced into a circuit-breaker period - similar to a lockdown - last year, there has not been a need to re-impose that because the healthcare system is not at the risk of being overwhelmed, said Dr Teo.

For one, in addition to current bed capacity, there was also the setting up of community facilities around the island last year to bolster capacity, he pointed out.

“After our initial fear that we saw in April (and) May last year, there is now built in place some additional surge capacity. It is not massive, it is never massive, but at least hospitals now have a better way of coordinating their resources to cope with rising numbers,” he added.

Speaking to CNA, Dr Dale Fisher, who is senior consultant at the National University Hospital’s division of infectious disease, noted that many countries have tried to find a compromise as part of their strategy to tackle COVID-19.

“Many countries have tried to find this middle ground - particularly Singapore obviously - of targeting specific things for specific reasons. So I don't think it's new,” he said.

“Now if you've got good contact tracing, good case isolation, good quarantining, good social distancing, good community buy in, capacity to scale up testing - if all these are in place, then really countries should be less inclined to do the blunt lockdowns.”

He noted that aside from countries with a strategy of complete elimination of the virus such as Australia, such a lockdown should not be the first option.

“It should have been a place of last resort, when you really had lost control of the situation. Your contact tracing couldn't keep up, your quarantining wasn't effective, or your case isolation was not in place - many countries didn't isolate their cases,” he added.

Dr Tambyah noted that such a total lockdown would be “very drastic” and have “numerous adverse consequences”. These include risks of death from falls in older people living alone, mental health problems in individuals who are isolated, as well as increases in domestic violence, among other things, he said.

Going back to such lockdowns would be a very “retrograde step”, added Dr Fisher.

“I think that would be a very retrograde step because we want to be pushing forward in opening up to achieve this balance of living with the virus and we don't want to have to be locking down regularly,” said Dr Fisher.

“I think what Singapore is doing is the right way, which is try and nuance your way through it, bring that number back down.”

WIDENING ‘INEQUITIES’

Dr Teo that “personal safe management measures” such as mask wearing and social distancing remain important.

“Once we started imposing face mask wearing, we never changed our stance on that, we never changed our stance on social distance, and neither our stance on group size restrictions. We have always maintained that there is a need to restrict group sizes, because whether it is for dining, coming together for things, those are the activities that have the highest risk of spreading (the virus),” he added.

And Dr Teo noted that acceptance of these measures remain high despite the fact that Singapore has been in this pandemic for over a year.

However, there remain disadvantages associated with such a targeted approach, he said. 

“Sectoral lockdowns actually widen inequities. Effectively, you are saying that certain sectors of the economy have to be shut down in order to allow other sectors of the economy to progress,” Dr Teo added.

As such, policies need to be put into place to ensure that these sectors are being looked after, amid the closures, he added.

On Friday, it was announced that F&B businesses, which are going to have to deal with the suspension of dine-in business, will get additional financial support.

Regardless of whether a total lockdown or targeted sectoral measures are put into place, Dr Ling noted that there is a risk of fatigue among the public.

“At this point in time, everyone knows that if we don't do something about it, it's just only going to get worse. And then it ends up being (a) total lockdown for everyone, which is even a lot worse. (It is akin to) choosing between the devil and deep blue sea, it's like there’s no good choice,” she said.

Given that safe management measures are not compulsory in some other countries, this could potentially exacerbate fatigue, she noted.

“In certain countries, it is very difficult to implement safe management measures and implement masking, to make it compulsory. And so when there are a lot of interactions, and when there is slight breakdown in any of these measures,  the cases will balloon, she said.

While other countries aim for a strategy which involves a total elimination of the virus, Singapore is trying to find a compromise between allowing economic activity, and some social activities to resume while trying to keep the public health situation under control, noted Dr Teo.

“It means that we will start to look at some of this dialing up and dialing down of our measures between phase three, phase two, phase three, phase two, even maybe going back to phase one from time to time. This will be something we have to be mentally prepared for,” he said.

At the same time, Dr Ling emphasised the need for Singaporeans to be constantly on their toes.

“The community has to be mentally prepared that COVID is going to be here to stay for an indefinite period of time,” she said.

“We being part of this community and being part of a global society, we just have to make sure that we try to keep it at bay for as long as we can. And we're going to have to do whatever we can to do that.”"
"Several eateries across Singapore, luxury ship added to list of places visited by COVID-19 cases","Several eateries across Singapore, seven malls and a luxury ship were among the locations added on Friday (May 14) to a list of public places visited by COVID-19 community cases during their infectious period.

INSTITUTES OF HIGHER LEARNING

All institutes of higher learning must keep in-person class and lecture sizes to no more than 50 people, with other larger classes and lectures to be conducted online. 

Dining in canteens and dining halls can continue with the necessary safe management measures, given that students and staff members are on campuses for a longer period of time, said MOE.

Examinations will be reformatted and conducted in classrooms with a maximum class size of 50 people. Where practicable, IHLs will conduct examinations online, said the ministry.

Internships and work attachments may continue.

MOE will continue to monitor the situation closely and work with schools and IHLs to implement additional safe management measures where necessary to ensure the well-being of students and staff, said the ministry. 

We urge all students and staff to consult a doctor immediately if they are feeling unwell, continue practising good personal hygiene and adhere to safe management measures.

PRIVATE TUITION CENTRES

Private education institutions offering pre-tertiary and tertiary courses must follow the tightened national safe management measures. 

As for private tuition and enrichment centres, they are encouraged to consider online lessons as the default arrangement during this period.

If in-person classes proceed, centres must comply strictly with the national safe management measures, including the following:

Step up screening for staff and students, so that those who are unwell do not attend lessons

All instructors/staff and students must wear masks

Students must maintain safe distancing of at least one metre from others and refrain from interacting. If some interaction is unavoidable, they must remain in pairs, with each pair maintaining a distance of at least one metre (preferably two metres) from other groups, with no mixing between groups; and

In-person singing and wind instrument classes will be suspended.

"2 new COVID-19 clusters in Singapore, including tuition centre where 5 students test positive","Two new COVID-19 clusters have been identified in Singapore on Friday (May 14), one of which is linked to a tuition centre where five children and a tutor tested positive.

Five of the 24 new community cases reported on Friday are linked to a previous case, Case 63131, a 50-year-old Singaporean woman who works as a tutor at Learning Point tuition centre at Parkway Centre, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said. She was confirmed to have COVID-19 on Wednesday.

All five new cases reported on Friday involved children aged seven to nine years who attended Case 63131’s classes at the tuition centre.

Among them are students from Kong Hwa School, St Stephen's School and St Andrew's Junior School. Some of the schools issued notices that they would conduct home-based learning after the detection of the cases.

ALL FIVE CHILDREN DEVELOPED SYMPTOMS

All five cases were identified as close contacts to the tutor and were placed in quarantine on May 12. They all developed symptoms, said MOH.

The first case, Case 63184, is a nine-year-old Singaporean boy studying at St Stephen’s School. He developed a fever on May 11 and sought treatment at a general practitioner clinic the next day. He did not to school after the onset of symptoms.

He was tested for COVID-19 on May 13, and the test result came back positive on the same day. His serology result is pending.

The second case, Case 63185, is a nine-year-old Singaporean girl who is a student at Kong Hwa School.

She developed a fever on May 12 and sought medical treatment at a general practitioner on the same day. She did not go to school after the onset of symptoms. She was tested for COVID-19 on May 13, and received a positive result on the same day. Her serology test is pending.

The third case, Case 63186, is a nine-year-old Singaporean boy who studies at St Andrew’s Junior School.

He developed a fever while in school on May 11 and sought medical treatment at a general practitioner clinic the following day. On May 13, he was tested for COVID-19 and he was confirmed to have COVID-19 on the same day. His serology test result is pending.

The fourth case, Case 63187, is an eight-year-old Singaporean boy who studies at Kong Hwa School.

He also developed a fever while in school on May 11, and sought medical treatment at a polyclinic on the same day. He was tested for COVID-19 on May 12, and it came back positive the next day. His serology test is pending.

The fifth case, Case 63188, is a seven-year-old Singaporean boy who studies at St Stephen’s School.

He developed a runny nose on May 11 but did not seek medical treatment. On May 13, he was tested for COVID-19 and it came back positive on the same day. His serology test is pending.

NO EVIDENCE OF SCHOOL TRANSMISSION

During a multi-ministry task force press conference on Friday, Education Minister Lawrence Wong said all infections of school-going children have happened outside of schools.

“We have a series of very tight measures to pick up and to detect and to ring-fence our school system,” he said.

“Up to now, there is no evidence of transmission within the school system, he added.

Mr Wong said that the Government will continue to monitor the situation closely and see if additional measures are required, after having tightened safe management measures in schools.

He also said that teachers will no longer be allowed to wear face shields instead of surgical masks while teaching.

NEW CLUSTER AFTER CASE LINKED TO NURSE

A new cluster of three has been identified after a new COVID-19 case was linked to a previous infection.

Case 63221 is a 39-year-old Filipino man who works at Unity Pharmacy.

He is a household contact of Case 63096, a 33-year-old Filipino man who works as an operating theatre nurse at Sengkang General Hospital. Case 63096 was confirmed to have COVID-19 on May 11.

The 39-year-old is also a family member of Case 63122, a seven-year-old Filipino student at Yio Chu Kang Primary School.

Case 63221 was placed in quarantine on May 11. He is asymptomatic and was detected when he was tested for COVID-19 on May 13. The following day, his test result came back positive. His serology test result is pending.

He received his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on Feb 23 and the second dose on Mar 22.

Singapore reported a total of 52 new COVID-19 cases on Friday, the highest since Jan 30. Of these, 24 were in the community, with 20 linked to previous cases. The remaining 28 cases are imported.

Singapore has reported a total of 61,505 COVID-19 cases and 31 fatalities from COVID-19 as of Friday.

"No dining-in at eateries: Restaurants pivot again, food delivery services gear up","Food and beverage businesses are bracing themselves for another round of disruption after authorities announced that dining-in will not be allowed from Sunday (May 16) until Jun 13 as part of measures to curb the spread of COVID-19.

Singapore will on Sunday enter what the Ministry of Health (MOH) labelled as Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) after a recent rise in COVID-19 cases in the community.

AdvertisementAdvertisement
Mr Kelvin Ong, CEO of Eurasia Global Food, said that the announcement was unexpected as Singapore appeared to be on the path of re-opening.

The company has a meat distribution business as well as 15 eateries under the brands of Gochi-So Shokudo and Tun Xiang.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
Mr Ong said that during circuit breaker last year, sales at the restaurants dived 70 per cent to 80 per cent. They had takeaway orders, but no deliveries. With the last minute announcement, he does not intend to set up a delivery service. 

This is so sudden, we have no time to react, he said, adding that he thinks the delivery platforms' fees are too high.

We can only hope our landlord and the MOM (Ministry of Manpower) are able to waive the rent and (foreign worker) levies for this period, to reduce our losses and keep us afloat as we are very worried the period will extend again.

Mr Collin Ho, CEO of SF Group, which runs Collin's restaurants, said that he had anticipated the stricter measures.

Given that we had responded swiftly to pivot our business to takeaways and deliveries arising from last year’s circuit breaker, we will now enhance our efforts on these two channels to cater to our customers working from home, he added. 

The group will go ahead with the opening of a new restaurant on Monday, he said, and serve customers through takeaways and deliveries.

Ms Vicky Hwang, owner of ATLAS Bar, said it will be another challenging period, but remained upbeat.

Let's all do the right thing and hopefully we can soon get back to welcoming guests again, she said.

The ATLAS bar at Parkview Square will switch back to delivering bottled cocktails and bar snacks to customers at home through its ATLAS Shop, which was launched during the circuit breaker last year. They will also be continuing takeaways for their food menu items.

The Restaurant Association of Singapore told CNA that the latest tightening of measures will definitely impact F&B businesses further. 

We urge our members and all F&B operators to quickly pivot their focus to food delivery to make up for the shortfall in the dining-in business, it said in a statement on Friday.

In addition, we would like to reach out to all landlords and food delivery platforms to work closely with our F&B operators, to provide them with much-needed rental and delivery cost aid during this difficult period.

Facebook groups such as Hawkers United - Dabao 2020 saw action again, with new posts on Friday promoting hawker stalls around Singapore.

Food delivery services told CNA that they are expecting a surge in demand.

With the tightening of measures announced today, Grab will be looking at different ways to further the support for our merchant-partners who are impacted. Details on these support initiatives will be shared very soon, said Ms Xinwei Ngiam, MD of deliveries at Grab Singapore.

Mr Varun Saraf, CEO of hawker food delivery platform WhyQ said that there was a 50 per cent increase in demand for their services during the circuit breaker last year.

This time we are expecting and have prepared for a 100 per cent increase as we have a larger vendor and customer base, he said.

We will also be hiring more delivery couriers, hawker captains, as well as run promotions funded by WhyQ to encourage our customers to support our hawkers via delivery.

WhyQ is also launching a new free-to-download app next week for hawkers to set up their own online stores, he said.

Hotels will also be affected, as they have been relying on domestic demand while waiting for international travel to resume, said Ms Kwee Wei-Lin, president of the Singapore Hotel Association. ????

Wedding banquets are also not allowed under the tighter measures.

There is no doubt that these new measures will impact our industry, especially those with restaurant and banquet operations, she said.

However, we recognise the adverse long-term implications if the Government does not make a decisive move to control local community transmission now.

Raffles Hotel's managing director Christian Westbeld said that the hotel's restaurants will cater for deliveries and takeaways, and guests on staycations at the hotel will have meals in-suite instead of at the restaurants.

As for wedding solemnisations and receptions, Raffles Hotel Singapore will continue to embrace full flexibility and coordinate individually with the wedding couples, as we always have, he said.

Tenants in talks with Jewel Changi Airport for assistance to tide over temporary closure,"SINGAPORE: Jewel Changi Airport said its tenants will get support, including rental assistance, to help them cope with the two-week closure that started on Thursday (May 13).

Jewel, as well as terminals 1 and 3, are closed to the public amid a rise in the number of cases linked to the airport. Authorities had begun special testing operations for workers there.

“Changi Airport Group is working with tenants in the terminals to minimise the impact of the temporary closure on their staff and operations, including rental waivers for the period of the closure, it said in response to queries. 

Jewel Changi Airport will also provide support measures including rental assistance to help its tenants during the closure.

A few tenants told CNA over email that they have been in touch with Jewel Changi Airport to get assistance.

Jewel Changi Airport had “proactively reached out to offer rebates on rent” for the two-week closure period, said Mr Edwin Lim, director of gelato shop Birds of Paradise.

“In Good Company and Birds of Paradise Gelato Boutique, being collaborators at the premises, continue to operate our stores at other locations. Each brand also continues to operate our online stores,” he added.  

At Tokyo Milk Cheese Factory, which has another outlet at Raffles City, the company is “currently in communication” with Jewel Changi Airport. 

“We believe that they will do what they can to aid us, as well as fellow Jewel tenants. We will continue to maintain an open channel of communication with (them) to seek goodwill assistance,” the management told CNA.

All workers from the Tokyo Milk Cheese Factory at Jewel have tested negative for COVID-19, having received the results on May 13, the management added. 

Rich & Good Cake Shop, however, has not heard from Jewel Changi Airport when it responded to CNA's queries on Friday. 

“We will definitely be severely impacted, as we have staff and a central kitchen to support. Our central kitchen bakes solely to supply our Jewel outlet, and to lose revenue from that outlet due to COVID-19 closures two years in a row is very damaging for our business,” said Ms Jerelyn Foo, the company’s media and operations manager.

“We will be opening our other outlet at Kandahar Street on Sundays and public holidays during these two weeks to cater to the demand.

The cake shop, she added, had “minimal staff” at the Jewel outlet, so they were able to “clear the swab test quickly”. 

Men's grooming salon Sultans of Shave said even before the closure, business has already been slower at their Jewel outlet in the past few months.

It now has no choice but to cancel all appointments at Jewel.

“Our staff at Jewel will undergo mandatory swab tests and have been advised to opt in to the vaccination plan for all personnel working in Changi Airport. We have also arranged for the outlet to be cleaned and sanitised more frequently,” said its group marketing executive Cin Yi.  

This time last year, Singapore was in a COVID-19 circuit breaker when social gatherings were not allowed among other restrictions. 

Amid the recent rise in community cases, authorities announced new measures on Friday, including a reduction in the size of group gatherings from five people to two. Dining in will not be allowed from May 16 through Jun 13.

COVID-19 TESTING IN THE CHANGI AIRPORT CLUSTER 

The Changi Airport COVID-19 cluster is currently Singapore's largest active cluster, with 59 cases as of Friday.

About 20 of the infections are congregated around one zone - an area that receives travellers from higher-risk regions, including South Asia, said Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung on Friday.

“That zone is our equivalent of Ward 9D, like Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), said Mr Ong, referring to Singapore's second-largest COVID-19 cluster.

“And from that zone, workers go have their lunch, go have their meals at the Terminal 3 Basement 2 commercial areas and the food court, and we suspect from there, it transmitted to members of the public that visited the place.” 

Changi Airport Group (CAG) said last week that about 9,000 workers from Terminal 1, Terminal 3 and Jewel Changi Airport will undergo COVID-19 testing. 

Mr Ong said on Friday that about 500 workers from Jewel have been swabbed, with all of them testing negative for COVID-19.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and CAG also urged all airport workers as well as employees working at Jewel Changi Airport to “refrain from going out except for essential work or activities for the next 14 days or until they have been tested negative for COVID-19”. 

In addition, these workers should not be redeployed to other workplaces or outlets during this period, they added. Workers at the airport will also be segregated according to higher-risk and lower-risk zones.

“We are cautiously hopeful that the airport worker cluster, just the worker cluster, hopefully can be contained,” said Mr Ong."
"Singapore shares tumble 2.2% to more than two-month lows, as tighter COVID-19 curbs raise jitters","Singapore shares tumbled to a more than two-month low on Friday (May 14), with aviation-related counters among the worst hit, as investors reacted to a further tightening in the country’s COVID-19 restrictions.

To curb the rising number of community infections, dining-in will once again be prohibited and a new limit of two people for all social gatherings will kick in from Sunday for four weeks. Among other measures, the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force also announced a return to working from home as the default.

The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) fell more than 3 per cent following the announcement just after 1pm, before clawing back some losses to close down 2.2 per cent or 68.24 points at 3,055.02. This marked the STI’s lowest level since Mar 8.

For the day, losers outnumbered gainers by 467 to 127 with 3.52 billion units worth S$3.22 billion changing hands.

“The market is not prepared for this drastic tightening of COVID-19 measures, which is happening so quickly after the earlier reduction,” said DailyFX’s strategist Margaret Yang, referring to how the group limit for social gatherings was cut from eight to five people slightly more than a week ago.

“It reflects that the situation may be worse than we anticipated,” she added. “On the economic level, there will also definitely be some adverse impact on the services and travel sectors.”

IG’s market strategist Yeap Jun Rong said the local equity market, which has chalked up a strong run since the start of the year, was pricing in a strong economic recovery on the back of a relatively controlled pandemic in Singapore.

“The recent resurgences seem to cast doubt on the pace of economic recovery ahead, leading to near-term weakness in the STI, considering that a significant proportion of its constituents are in cyclicals,” he told CNA. A cyclical stock is one whose underlying business generally follows the economic cycle.

Aviation counters were among those badly hit. National carrier Singapore Airlines (SIA) fell 5.7 per cent to an 11-week low of S$4.50, while flight caterer SATS dropped 3.9 per cent to S$3.69. 

In addition to the heightened restrictions, the air travel bubble between Singapore and Hong Kong that was due to start on May 26 may be in for another delay. Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung said on Friday it is “very likely” that Singapore will not be able to meet the criteria for the travel bubble to go ahead.

“Investors had been hoping for the roll-out of the vaccine to spur an economic recovery and a broader border reopening, but we are now moving backwards and it might take longer than we thought for the aviation industry to recovery,” said Ms Yang.

Integrated resort operator Genting Singapore declined 3.1 per cent to S$0.79.

Banking heavyweights were also in the red – OCBC and UOB lost more than 2 per cent each, while DBS dropped 0.7 per cent.

On the other hand, shares of supermarket chain Sheng Siong surged nearly 11 per cent to S$1.66. 

Describing this aso a knee jerk reaction to the ban on dine-ins, Ms Yang said: “If you look around, there are not a lot of safe-haven stcks left. Most of the sectors are badly hurt and supermarkets are the only ones benefiting from this return to stricter measures.”

Among other heavily-traded stocks, Singtel fell 3.7 per cent to S$2.32 after warning that it expects to record net exceptional losses of S$1.21 billion in its full-year results, mostly due to the impairment of assets and goodwill at two businesses.

MORE DOWNSIDE TO COME?

Moving forward, the number of unlinked community cases will likely play a part in determining how the stock market moves over the next two weeks, said CMC Markets analyst Kelvin Wong.

“If the number of unlinked community cases continues to be on the rise in the next two weeks, it implies that more stringent measures are likely to be implemented such as a ‘circuit breaker 2.0’,” he said.

“Thus, stocks that are geared towards hospitality and travel, such as Genting, SIA, CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust may see further declines.”

Mr Yeap also expects stocks related to the retail, hospitality and entertainment sectors to come under further pressure, given uncertainties about how the COVID-19 situation will evolve.

Investors may opt for a “risk-off approach” in the near term, he said, considering that the STI has had a strong run since the start of the year and “may be due for some profit-taking” given the current uncertainties.

“That said, the overall downside impact may be limited considering that prompt action was taken to limit the virus spread and more than 20 per cent of Singapore’s population has been fully vaccinated,” said the market analyst from IG.

"Up to S$8,000 in funding for companies to provide rest areas for outsourced workers","Companies can now tap grants of up to S$8,000 to provide new rest areas for their outsourced cleaners or security officers. 

Under the Workcare Grant launched on Friday (May 14), eligible companies can get funding support of up to 80 per cent of costs incurred from creating a new rest area, capped at S$8,000.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
The funding provided to improve an existing rest area is capped at S$3,000.

The S$1 million Workcare Grant is expected to benefit more than 2,000 outsourced essential services workers such as cleaners and security officers, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) in a media release. 

“I think all of us recognise that many of our lower-wage workers perform essential services, and they are valued members of our community. And so in terms of how we uplift them, the Government has taken a holistic approach,” said Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo, speaking to journalists on Zoom. 

She urged service buyers and building owners to take up the grant.

“This is something that can be done, said Mrs Teo.

It is not very complicated, it takes a little bit of effort on the part of the service providers, and so our call to them is to ask that they respond positively to this movement where we all do our part to show concern for essential services workers. Let them know that they are valued members of the community.” 

The grant follows a pilot study conducted by MOM to test out ways to improve rest areas for outsourced cleaners.

The study identified some “low-cost” and “easy-to-implement” measures for service buyers and providers to improve rest areas for outsourced employees. 

These include providing secure lockers to store personal belongings safely and allowing workers to customise their rest areas to instil a sense of belonging. 

Other measures include showcasing the work and efforts of workers to build a connection between them and the residents or tenants, as well as creating opportunities for residents or tenants to appreciate the contribution of workers, said MOM.

“Many of us see cleaners, security officers, sometimes taking their meals in staircase landings, it’s really quite sad,” said Senior Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad. 

“We want to uplift them and ensure that they are given proper conditions, proper areas of rest. And we want to encourage as many building owners, service providers to work with us through the alliances that they’re working with now,” he said, adding that it is heartening to see NGOs and other organisations working together to create new ideas to improve rest areas.

“I think COVID-19 has also shown how important our essential workers have been to not just the economy, but the many of us in society, supporting us in many unseen works such as cleaning, security, said Mr Zaqy.

And I think it is right for us as a society to be inclusive, to bring them along with us, and hopefully we can be fairer and more inclusive in the way we treat our lower-wage workers.” "
Singapore’s stocks ‘adequate’ at supermarkets and ‘supply lines intact’: Chan Chun Sing,"Singapore’s stocks are “adequate” and “supply lines are intact”, said Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing on Friday (May 14) as long queues were observed at supermarkets following the announcement of tighter COVID-19 measures.

“All retail outlets, including supermarkets, will remain open during this period. Our stocks are adequate. Our supply lines are intact, said Mr Chan in a Facebook post.

“Let us continue to remember to buy only what we need and look out for the more vulnerable among us.” 

It was announced on Friday that dining-in at all food and beverage outlets would be suspended from May 16 through Jun 13 amid a rise in COVID-19 community cases.

Shortly after that, photos and videos of long queues and empty shelves at supermarkets surfaced on social media.

In response to CNA's queries, Dairy Farm Group said it has seen an increase in store traffic after the latest announcements. 

“We want to encourage customers to shop safely and responsibly as they can be assured that we have sufficient stock across our stores and warehouses. All Cold Storage and Giant supermarkets are well-prepared to meet customers’ needs,” said the company’s spokesperson. 

“We have put in place measures to ensure that our supply chain remains diversified and robust, and is able to evolve with the changing environment and any anticipated challenges.”

The staff manpower in Dairy Farm Group supermarkets has also been increased for crowd management and to ensure that customers adhere to safe distancing measures, said the spokesperson.

The TraceTogether gateway system and app have also been implemented to enable contact tracing, and the number of customers in each store will be limited, the spokesperson added. High touch point areas like baskets and trolleys are also disinfected every two hours. 

A Sheng Siong spokesperson also echoed the same sentiment: “We advise customers to stay calm, and do not over purchase on groceries and necessities. Our sources of supply are well-diversified and we will continue to work closely with our suppliers.” 

The supermarket’s supply chain is “resilient” and it has sufficient local inventory for food supplies and toiletries to meet customers’ daily needs, the spokesman told CNA. 

“Our stores will remain open and we will continue to replenish our stocks regularly.” 

In a press release on Friday, NTUC FairPrice said its network of stores and online shopping portal will remain open “and there is no need to rush or over purchase during this period.

“While there will not be any purchase limits imposed, the co-operative is monitoring the situation closely and urges all shoppers to only buy what they need while continuing to observe safe management protocols.

The company said it has also increased its inventory holding for certain categories of products like high-demand items such as rice, noodles and paper products. 

FairPrice added that it maintains a stockpile of more than three months’ worth of rice. 

FairPrice Group chief executive and Member of Parliament Seah Kian Peng also took to Facebook following Friday’s announcement. 

“We are seeing more traffic and bigger purchases at our FairPrice stores and online platform since the announcement at midday,” he wrote. 

Mr Seah said in the press release that the team is “in a better position” to manage the situation from the experience gained last year. 

“However, we seek our customers' patience and understanding that due to the larger crowd volume and bigger basket sizes during this period, we may require a slightly longer time to replenish our shelves and queuing time may also be slightly longer,” he added.

ONLINE GROCERY SHOPPING

Foodpanda has seen a 50 per cent increase in orders on pandamart after the announcement earlier on Friday, specifically on essential goods such as toilet paper, canned and frozen foods as well as instant noodles, said a spokesperson for the company. 

“We currently do not have any plans to put in place purchase caps on essential items,” the spokesperson added. 

In response to CNA queries, a Lazada spokesman said RedMart has “sufficient stocks for everyday essentials” like rice, flour, meats, noodles and toilet paper. 

CNA has observed purchase caps on some items on RedMart, including paper products and rice. 

“We remain committed to fulfilling orders, and will continue to add daily delivery slots, as well as increase delivery capacity, to cater to the increase,” said the spokesman, adding that sources have been scaled up to meet growing demand. 

“We have diversified our supply chain to ensure that our suppliers continue to provide us with the necessary items on a daily basis,” the Lazada spokesman said. “We encourage customers to shop responsibly in light of the new measures, and only buy what is necessary.”

In addition to suspending dining-in at F&B outlets, the current size of group gatherings allowed will be reduced from five people to two people, announced co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force Lawrence Wong on Friday. This follows a spike in COVID-19 community cases in recent weeks. 

Singapore reported 24 community cases among the 52 new COVID-19 infections as of Friday. This is the highest number of new daily COVID-19 cases since Jan 30, when 58 cases were reported. 

Twenty of the new community cases are linked to previous clusters, of which 13 have been linked to the Changi Airport cluster.

First 20 Changi Airport COVID-19 cases from zone that receives arrivals from higher-risk countries: Ong Ye Kung,"About 20 COVID-19 cases at Changi Airport were quite congregated around one zone - an area that receives travellers from higher-risk regions, including South Asia, said Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung on Friday (May 14).

Speaking at a multi-ministry task force press conference, Mr Ong said the airport has plotted the first 20-odd infections, and they were mostly from one zone.

“This is the zone with a finger pier that receives higher-risk country arrivals, including (from) South Asia, and then the conveyor belt and immigration. So it’s that whole zone, and infections were all around that area,” said the minister.

“That zone is our equivalent of Ward 9D, like Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).

“And from that zone, workers go have their lunch, go have their meals at the Terminal 3 Basement 2 commercial areas and the food court, and we suspect from there, it transmitted to members of the public that visited the place.” 

Many of the COVID-19 cases in the TTSH cluster are linked to Ward 9D.

Mr Ong noted that more than 90 per cent of frontline workers at the airport have been vaccinated. Some cases linked to the airport cluster have tested preliminarily positive for the B1617 variant, which was first detected in India.

“But unfortunately this mutant virus (is) very virulent, it broke through the layers of defence,” he said. 

BIG WORRY IS ONWARD COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION

In the Ministry of Health's (MOH) daily preliminary update, 13 of the 24 new community cases reported on Friday were linked to the Changi Airport cluster. That means the cluster now has 59 cases.

Mr Ong said they are cautiously hopeful that the worker cluster at the airport can be contained through quarantine and testing.

The big worry now is ... the onward community transmission coming out of the commercial area in T3 B2.

The first airport worker case was detected on May 6, noted Mr Ong. A Victoria Junior College student who tested positive on May 7 was linked to the cluster on May 11, after it was found that she had visited the Terminal 3 Basement 2 food court on the same day as two other cases. 

“Immediately, the next day, we took action, closed down the entire commercial area in T3 Basement 2 for deep cleaning, and then we started special ops with MOH to test 9,000 workers in T1, T3 plus Jewel.” 

As a precaution, Jewel has also been closed since Thursday for two weeks, he added.

As of Thursday night, 7,641 workers have been tested, and almost 6,000 workers have received their results. There were six positive cases, detected in the first two days of the special testing operations, said Mr Ong, adding that about 500 workers in Jewel have tested negative.

Workers who were in close contact with earlier cases are in quarantine and are being tested, said the minister.

Every day for the past couple of days, there have been 10 cases. I think yesterday was 13 cases (who) tested positive. And this is the number that (has) been contributing to our community cases that have been reported, he added.

Of the 28 workers who were infected, 19 of them were fully vaccinated. “And the last I checked, all are well, and no one is on oxygen,” said Mr Ong.

Adding that the airport has since tightened safety measures, Mr Ong said the airport will now be divided into higher-risk zones and lower-risk zones. 

“In higher-risk zones, the workers are cohorted - so if you work in a higher risk zone you stay within that.” 

Workers in higher risk zones also don full category 2 personal protective equipment (PPE), while cleaners don full category 1 PPE, said the Transport Minister. They will also have to take their meals within that zone. 

“It’s a concept of segregation that they have started to implement,” he added.

BIGGEST CHALLENGE

With the aviation industry affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, workers at Changi Airport are facing “probably their biggest challenge since Singapore became independent”, said Mr Ong. 

“And now they are hit with a COVID-19 cluster. They have been on the frontline, risking their own safety, day in day out for the past 16 months, for a task that is entrusted upon them, and I think they really did their best,” he added. 

“(They) donned PPE, they observed safety precautions, put themselves through regular testing (every) 14 days, some seven days. When vaccines first came out, and Singaporeans were uncertain or jittery about vaccines, they decided to take the plunge first.” 

He called for people to support airport workers during this time.

On Wednesday, MOH said it would offer free testing for members of the public who had visited Terminal 3 from May 3 onwards. The ministry on Thursday extended the free testing to those who visited Terminal 3 from May 1. 

MOH will progressively inform these individuals via SMS notification with information on how to book an appointment for their test, it added.

All visitors to Terminal 1 and Jewel from May 1 onwards are also advised to monitor their health closely for 14 days from their date of visit and see a doctor if unwell. 

They are strongly encouraged to visit a regional screening centre or Swab and Send Home Public Health Preparedness Clinic for a free COVID-19 test if they feel unwell, added MOH.

"Put your tray away: 7 things to know about clearing your table at hawker centres, coffee shops and food courts","Diners at hawker centres will face fines from Sep 1 if they do not clear dirty trays, crockery and litter from their tables.

Enforcement will also be rolled out to coffee shops and food courts in the fourth quarter of the year, said the National Environment Agency (NEA) on Friday (May 14).

AdvertisementAdvertisement
These measures will help Singapore transition to a “more socially conscious, self-service concept”, allowing diners to have their meals in clean and hygienic environments and protect against public health risks, said NEA.

Here are seven things to keep in mind the next time you dine at a hawker centre, coffee shop or food court.

WHAT AM I NOT ALLOWED TO LEAVE ON DINING TABLES?

Diners are not allowed to leave dirty trays, crockery and litter on the table. Examples of litter include used tissues and wet wipes, straws, wrappers, canned drinks and plastic bottles.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
Food remnants such as shells and bones are also considered litter. Leaving them on the table will be an offence.

However, diners who put their litter together with their dirty trays and crockery at return stations will not be penalised.

If you have accidentally spilled gravy or a drink on the table, that is not considered litter.

“As much as practicable, diners can help to clean the spilled gravy or drink and keep the table clean,” said NEA, adding that enforcement will take a pragmatic approach.

WHAT ARE THE PENALTIES IF I DON’T CLEAR THE TABLE?

Before the fines kick in, there will be an advisory period from June to August for the public to adjust. During this period, enforcement officers will remind diners to clean up after themselves but will not fine them.

From Sep 1, the officers will continue to advise diners to clear their tables. They will go on to take enforcement action if diners do not heed the advice.

If you are a first-time offender, you will get a written warning.

If you are a second-time offender, you get a fine of S$300. This is similar to the amount for other compoundable littering offences, said NEA.

Repeat offenders may face court fines.

DO I HAVE TO CLEAR WHAT’S LEFT BEHIND BY OTHER DINERS?

No. Cleaners will help to clear dirty trays, crockery and litter left behind by previous diners.

But all diners are urged to keep tables clean as this “shows consideration” for the next diner, said NEA.

WHAT IF MY LITTER WAS BLOWN ONTO THE FLOOR?

If you use a tissue and it gets blown onto the floor by a breeze, be sure to pick it up and throw it away.

Allowing litter to be blown onto the floor in a public place and not picking it up is an offence, said NEA.

“No one should leave behind any litter in any public place, except in a dustbin or other receptacle provided for the deposit of refuse and rubbish,” said the agency.

WILL THE ELDERLY, CHILDREN AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES BE PENALISED AS WELL?

The less-abled or “frail elderly” who are unable to clear their tables will not be penalised, said NEA.

People with disabilities will not be penalised either, said the agency, citing its pragmatic approach to enforcement.

As for children under 12, officers will educate them on the importance of leaving a clean table for the next diner.

Dining companions of these groups of people should help them dispose of litter and return dirty trays and crockery.

WILL CLEANERS LOSE THEIR JOBS IF I CLEAR THE TABLE MYSELF?

No. In fact, clearing your own table will allow cleaners to focus on the “most important task” of cleaning and disinfecting tables, said NEA.

“Cleaners will not lose their jobs just because diners clear their trays, as they are still required to maintain and upkeep the general cleanliness of dining places,” said the agency.

This includes wiping and sanitising tables, and clearing and sorting dirty crockery at designated return points.

When diners clear their own tables, this reduces the need for cleaners to make frequent rounds and facilitates faster turnover of tables during peak mealtimes, said NEA.

It also means a safer and more sanitary working environment for cleaners.

Public dining places have a tight cleaning workforce that is mostly made up of seniors, who may be more vulnerable to diseases like COVID-19, said NEA.

“There will be benefits to both hawkers and patrons, and redesigning of the cleaning role in consideration of our ageing cleaning workforce, said the agency, adding the average age of cleaners is 60. 

WHY IS THE ROLL-OUT LATER FOR COFFEE SHOPS AND FOOD COURTS?

Hawker centres are prioritised for enforcement because they have high footfall and exposure to bird encroachment, said NEA.

But the requirement on clearing tables applies to all public dining places, including hawker centres, coffee shops and food courts."
Shangri-La Dialogue organiser remains 'committed' to holding this year’s event in person,"The organiser of the Shangri-La Dialogue said it “remain(s) committed” to holding this year's event in person, after the Singapore government on Friday (May 14) announced tighter COVID-19 safety measures. 

The defence summit draws delegates from dozens of countries each year. It is scheduled to be held on Jun 4 and 5 this year.

Since its launch in 2002, it has been held in Singapore annually except for last year when it was cancelled due to global COVID-19 travel restrictions. 

In a statement on Friday, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) told CNA that it is aware of the announcement by Singapore’s COVID-19 multi-ministry task force.

“We remain committed to holding the 19th Shangri-La Dialogue in person in early June,” said a spokesperson.

“We will review our safe management measures in light of today’s news to ensure the highest safety levels for all our participants and the wider community in Singapore.”

The spokesperson added that IISS will continue to monitor the local and global COVID-19 situation closely.

Amid a rise in community cases, the multi-ministry task force held a media conference on Friday announcing tighter measures, including a cap of 100 people at conferences with pre-event testing and 50 without testing.

On whether conferences such as the Shangri-La Dialogue and the World Economic Forum in August will go ahead, co-chair of the task force Lawrence Wong said that the organisers are monitoring the situation globally and in Singapore “very closely” and will provide updates in due course.

“As far as the Singapore side is concerned, we are in touch with them and we will provide them the latest information on our prevailing public health updates and cases, measures we are taking, so that they have the latest information to decide on the events,” he said.

Mr Wong added that organisers will also consider the broader public health situation and whether potential attendees are prepared to travel.

Participants expected at the Shangri-La Dialogue include US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and keynote speaker Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.

New COVID-19 measures in What is allowed under the tighter restrictions?,"The Ministry of Health (MOH) announced tighter measures on Friday (May 14) after a spike in COVID-19 community cases. The new measures, labelled as Phase 2 (heightened alert), will take effect from May 16 to Jun 13. 

Dining-in at F&B establishments will not be allowed, said Education Minister Lawrence Wong at a press conference. This includes hawker centres and food courts, both indoors and outdoors.

The current size of group gatherings allowed will also be reduced from five people to two people.

Here are some of what is allowed, and what is not allowed, under the new measures: 

IS DINING IN ALLOWED? 

No, dining-in at F&B establishments will cease on May 16. This includes hawker centres and food courts, both indoor and outdoors. Instead, takeaway and delivery options are available. 

AdvertisementAdvertisement
This is to reduce the risk of community transmissions, said MOH. It added that F&B establishments are a higher-risk setting as customers often dine for prolonged periods in close proximity with one another with their masks off.

CAN I STILL MEET UP WITH MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY?

Yes, but households can only receive up to two unique visitors a day. Social gatherings are also allowed, with up to two per day, whether to another household or in a public place.

Grandchildren who are cared for by their grandparents are not included in the number of household visitors or social gatherings per day, said MOH. 

For group gatherings, only up to two people are allowed. 

AM I ALLOWED TO WORK IN THE OFFICE?

Work-from-home will be the default at workplaces and employers must ensure that employees who are able to work from home do so. There should also be no cross-deployment of workers to multiple worksites. 

Social gatherings at the workplace are also not allowed. Employees can have their meal breaks in the workplaces but they should refrain from intermingling with their colleagues when their masks are taken off while eating. 

Employers should also continue to stagger the start times of employees who need to return to the workplace and implement flexible working hours. 

CAN I STILL ATTEND WORSHIP SERVICES?

Congregational and other worship services are allowed to continue with a reduced capacity of 50 attendees at any one time without pre-event testing. Up to 100 attendees are allowed with pre-event testing implemented. 

However, live singing and playing of wind instruments will be suspended. 

To further mitigate the risk of spread through aerosol transmissions, religious workers and all other participants must wear their masks at all times, said MOH. 

ARE WEDDINGS AND FUNERALS ALLOWED TO GO ON? 

Yes, marriage solemnisations are allowed to continue, with up to 50 attendees without pre-event testing and 100 attendees with pre-event testing. 

However, wedding receptions will not be allowed, in line with measures on dine-in F&B establishments. 

For funerals, a total of 20 people or fewer are allowed at all days of the funeral, which includes burial or cremation. This is down from the current cap of 30 people. 

WILL ATTRACTIONS, TOURS AND SHOPPING MALLS CLOSE?

Tour groups are still allowed to operate, with up to 20 people per tour. Museums and public libraries will be allowed to operate at a reduced capacity of 25 per cent. 

Attractions that received the Ministry of Trade and Industry's prior approval to operate will have their operating capacity reduced to 25 per cent, down from the current capacity of 50 per cent. Indoor and outdoor shows may proceed with up to 100 people with pre-event testing, and up to 50 people without.

Shopping malls and showrooms will have their occupancy limits further reduced, from the current 10 sqm per person of gross floor area to 16 sq m per person. Odd and even date entry restrictions on Sundays for popular malls, such as Lucky Plaza and Peninsula Plaza, will continue. 

CAN I STILL GO TO THE CINEMAS OR ATTEND LIVE EVENTS? 

Cinemas will be allowed to operate, with up to 100 people allowed into the halls with pre-event testing implemented. Only up to 50 people may be allowed without pre-event testing. The prevailing group size of two people still applies. 

However, food and beverages may not be sold or consumed in the cinema. 

Meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE) events and live performances are allowed, with up to 100 people with pre-event testing and up to 50 people without. 

Speakers and performers are not allowed to remove their masks. Singing or playing of wind and brass instruments are also not allowed. 

No spectators are also allowed at sports events and all planned mass participation sports events continue to be closed. 

CAN I GO FOR DENTAL OR FACIAL APPOINTMENTS? 

Services that require masks to be removed, such as facials and saunas, are not allowed. These services will have to cease operating. 

However, dental and medical consultations are still allowed as these require patients to have their masks off. 

AM I ALLOWED TO PLAY SPORTS INDOORS?

No, strenuous indoor exercise classes, as well as strenuous individual and group indoor sports and activities will not be allowed. The recent clusters have shown that higher attack rates and secondary transmission occur in mask-off settings.

NEW CLUSTER AT LEARNING POINT

Five cases have been linked to a new cluster at Learning Point, a tuition centre. There are four boys and a girl, aged seven to nine. Two of them are from St Stephen's School while another two are from Kong Hwa School. The remaining case is from St Andrew's Junior School. 

The first detected case at the cluster was Case 63131, a 50-year-old Singaporean tutor who works at the centre. She was confirmed to have COVID-19 on May 12.

All of them had attended Case 63131's classes at Learning Point, located at Parkway Centre. 

The five students developed symptoms such as fever or runny nose prior to being diagnosed with COVID-19.

The cluster now has a total of six cases. 

NEW CLUSTER LINKED TO SENGKANG GENERAL HOSPITAL NURSE

A 39-year-old Philippine national who works at Unity Pharmacy is a household contact of Case 63096, a Philippine national who works as an operating theatre nurse at Sengkang General Hospital. 

He is also a family member of Case 63122, a seven-year-old Filipino boy who is a student at Yio Chu Kang Primary School. 

This new cluster currently has a total of three cases.

88-YEAR-OLD LINKED TO TAN TOCK SENG HOSPITAL CLUSTER

Another case has been added to the cluster at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). 

The 88-year-old Singaporean man had been warded in Ward 9D from Apr 19. He was transferred to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Apr 29 and has been warded there since. 

He was tested for COVID-19 daily from May 2 and all his test results were negative for COVID-19. 

On May 12, his test came back positive. His serology test result is negative.

FOUR UNLINKED CASES

The unlinked cases include a fully vaccinated Chinese national employed by SATS Food Services as a cook at Changi Prison. He developed a fever and runny nose on May 12 after work and sought medical treatment at a general practitioner (GP) clinic where he was tested for COVID-19. 

His test result came back positive the next day and his serology test result is pending. The man had received his first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine on Mar 23 and the second dose on Apr 10.

The second case is a Singaporean who works as a cook at WOK HEY at White Sands shopping mall. The 22-year-old developed a fever, cough and runny nose on the evening of May 10 and sought medical treatment at a GP clinic the next day where he was tested for COVID-19. 

His test result came back positive on May 13 and his serology test result is pending.

Another unlinked case, a 70-year-old Singaporean, is a retiree. She developed a fever and cough on the evening of May 10 and sought medical treatment at a GP clinic the next day where she was tested for COVID-19. Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on May 13 and her serology test result is pending.

The remaining unlinked case is a GrabFood delivery man. The 48-year-old Singaporean developed a fever, cough and sore throat on the night of May 12 and sought medical treatment at Singapore General Hospital the next day where he was tested for COVID-19. 

His test came back positive on May 14, and his serology test result is pending.

More information on individual cases can be found in the Health Ministry's daily situation report. 

6 SINGAPOREANS AMONG IMPORTED CASES

The remaining 28 cases reported on Friday were imported and were placed on stay-home notice upon their arrival in Singapore. 

Six Singaporeans and 13 permanent residents who returned from India, Indonesia, South Korea and the United Kingdom are among the cases.

Three imported cases are work pass holders who arrived from Nepal and Papua New Guinea. Four cases are work permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, Indonesia and the Philippines, of whom three are foreign domestic workers. 

The arrivals from the Indian sub-continent had already come into Singapore before the restrictions on travel were imposed, the Health Ministry said.

The remaining two imported cases are a student’s pass holder who arrived from Thailand and a short-term visit pass holder who arrived from Indonesia to seek medical treatment and visit his family member who is a permanent resident.

MOH said the short-term visit pass holder was already receiving medical care in Singapore, and had returned for follow-up treatment. 

The 70-year-old man arrived from Indonesia on Apr 23 and served his stay-home notice at a dedicated facility until May 7. His swab done on May 6 during the stay-home notice was negative for COVID-19. 

The Indonesia national is asymptomatic and was detected when he was tested for COVID-19 on May 12 in preparation for surgery. His test result came back positive the next day, although the Ct value was very high. This is indicative of a low viral load, said MOH. 

His serological test result has also come back positive. 

“Given that these indicate likely past infection, we have classified the case as imported. He is likely to be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and infective to others,” said MOH. 

No new infections were reported in foreign workers' dormitories.

INCREASE IN OVERALL NEW COMMUNITY CASES

MOH said the overall number of new cases in the community has increased from 43 cases in the week before to 91 cases in the past week. 

The number of unlinked cases in the community has increased from nine cases in the week before to 16 cases in the past week. 

Among the 194 confirmed cases reported from May 8 to May 14, a total of 66 cases have tested positive for their serology tests while 88 have tested negative. A further 40 serology test results are pending.

Eighteen more cases have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, bringing Singapore's total recoveries to 61,047.

There are 180 cases still in hospital. Most of them are stable or improving, and three are in critical condition in the intensive care unit. Another 247 are being isolated and cared for at community facilities.

GATHERINGS LIMITED TO TWO, NO DINING-IN

Group gatherings will be capped at two, down from the current five, as part of tightened restrictions announced on Friday. 

“This will apply across the board, so if you want to go out for anything, grocery shopping, exercise, maximum of two persons henceforth, said Mr Lawrence Wong, the co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force.

Households will also be allowed to receive only two distinct visitors a day. The previous limit was five.

Other measures that were introduced included a suspension of dining-in at food outlets, while working from home will again be the default at workplaces.

The new restrictions take effect from Sunday until Jun 13.

As of Friday, Singapore has reported a total of 61,505 COVID-19 cases and 31 fatalities from the disease.

"Court orders lawyer M Ravi to pay prosecution S$5,000 citing improper conduct, abuse of process","The Court of Appeal on Friday (May 14) ordered lawyer M Ravi to pay the prosecution personal costs of S$5,000 over an application he made in the case of a drug trafficker on death row.

The three-judge court called Mr Ravi's conduct egregious, improper and even grandstanding, choosing to advance an unmeritorious application and incurring unnecessary costs, and raising various arguments to see what would stick.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
Delivering the judgment on behalf of Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon and Judge of Appeal Judith Prakash, Justice Andrew Phang said Mr Ravi had brought the application in abuse of process and acted improperly, with his conduct (falling) short of what is expected of reasonable defence counsel.

The case involved Syed Suhail Syed Zin, who was convicted in 2015 of a capital charge of possessing heroin for trafficking. He was set to hang on Sep 18 last year, but his execution was stayed at the last minute after Mr Ravi stepped in.

Mr Ravi sought a review of the court's 2018 decision to uphold Syed's conviction and sentence on two grounds, but the Court of Appeal dismissed this application for a review in October last year, stressing that the review process is not to be invoked lightly.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
During the hearing, Mr Ravi argued that Senior Counsel Francis Ng and his team of prosecutors should be disqualified from representing the prosecution, because they had come into contact with a letter from Syed to his then-counsel Ramesh Tiwary and four letters from Syed to his uncle.

The court declined to disqualify the prosecution, finding that Mr Ravi had failed to show any basis for his application, especially since none of the prosecutors had sight of any such letters.

PROSECUTION SOUGHT S$10,000

After dismissing Mr Ravi's application, the court heard arguments about whether a personal costs order is appropriate. The prosecution called for Mr Ravi to pay them S$10,000 in personal costs, saying his conduct was plainly unreasonable and improper.

The prosecutors said Mr Ravi's real purpose in mounting the review application appears to have been to frustrate the lawful process of the execution of the sentence provided by law, adopting a blunderbuss approach that was an abuse of process.

They added that Mr Ravi had misrepresented or omitted facts about previous proceedings, raised legally unsustainable arguments and made unjustified allegations against Syed's previous counsel without giving him a chance to respond.

Mr Ravi argued that no personal costs order should be made against him, saying he had a reasonable basis to believe in good faith that the application was not bound to fail.

The court found that Mr Ravi had made unsubstantiated allegations against Syed's previous lawyer, finding this a particularly egregious failure. The allegations were ultimately distracting and gave rise to arguments based on false premises, the judges said.

Because Mr Ravi had failed to seek explanations from the previous lawyer over his conduct, the court found that Mr Ravi had failed to take reasonable care to ensure that he presented the truth to the court.

We state here clearly that such haphazard and irresponsible attempts at reopening concluded appeals will be looked upon with disfavour, said Justice Phang.

COURT SLAMS M RAVI'S CONDUCT

He added that Mr Ravi's arguments lacked any merit as they were attempts to relitigate what had already been conceded or determined in previous proceedings, and there was simply no new evidence or argument to be raised. This was entirely contrary to what was required for such an application to be mounted.

The court found the fact that Mr Ravi represented Syed pro bono to be irrelevant, saying that there is no reason for a pro bono lawyer to be held to any lower standard than a lawyer representing a paying client.

While encouraging counsel to take up cases pro bono for needy clients, a practice that exemplifies the best traditions of the Bar, the court said there is no public interest in withholding criticism and adverse cost orders against counsel whose improper conduct amounts to an abuse of the court's process.

Put another way, there is a public interest in maintaining standards at the Bar, and it is that interest that a personal costs order in the present case aims to advance, said Justice Phang.

We hope that Mr Ravi, and indeed all counsel who may be involved in similar proceedings, will take this decision in the spirit in which it is intended, and recognise that the order reflects the fact that defence counsel are indispensable for the proper administration of justice and that the requisite standards have therefore to be rigorously enforced."
"National Wages Council extends wage, employment guidelines to Nov 30 amid uneven outlook","The National Wages Council (NWC) on Friday (May 14) said its latest guidelines on wage and employment-related issues will be extended until November as they “remain relevant” amid an uneven economic recovery ahead.

However, it urged employers to re-evaluate their business situations and how the guidelines would apply to them. For instance, those seeing a recovery or growth should take steps to restore wages, reward their employees fairly and bring forward hiring plans, the NWC said in an addendum to extend its 2020/2021 guidelines.

AdvertisementAdvertisement
The council added that it will convene for a second time later in the year to develop guidelines for the period from Dec 1, 2021 to Nov 30, 2022, given a “dynamic and evolving” COVID-19 pandemic.

The NWC is a tripartite body made up of representatives from businesses, unions and the Government.

It usually convenes once a year to recommend guidelines on wage adjustments and other employment issues, but it met twice last year – marking only the fourth time it did so since its formation in 1972 – as the COVID-19 pandemic pummelled the economy and labour market.

AdvertisementAdvertisement
In March last year, the NWC called for struggling companies considering wage cuts to have their management teams lead by example, as part of guidelines for employers to sustain their businesses and save jobs.

The council followed up with supplementary guidelines in October, which said companies that have already exhausted other cost-saving measures should consider implementing temporary wage cuts, but only to the extent needed to minimise retrenchments.

Since then, authorities have penciled in the possibility of better-than-expected growth for the Singapore economy this year - with gross domestic product (GDP) likely exceeding 6 per cent – but they have also cautioned of an uneven recovery.

Advertisement
Likewise for the labour market, improvements this year “may be gradual and uneven across sectors”.

A patchy recovery translates into uncertain prospects for some businesses, said the NWC.

Businesses continue to face increased costs brought about by the pandemic, such as higher freight and transport charges and higher operating expenses as they comply with the safety measures. Qage subsidies under the Jobs Support Scheme has also ended for many industries, and will taper off and expire in September.

“Given the current economic outlook, the 2020/2021 guidelines and supplementary guidelines remain relevant and continue to provide guidance to employers on sustaining their businesses, saving jobs, pressing on with business and workforce transformation, and recognising the contributions of the employees fairly,” the NWC said in its addendum.

Speaking to reporters at a press conference, NWC chairman Peter Seah said: “It’s not an easy call to make but looking at the situation, we felt that it is very difficult at this point in time to come up with new guidelines to help employers and workers navigate the situation.

“Perhaps by November we can have a clearer picture and we can come up with a more appropriate guideline to guide employers and employees.”

APPLY GUIDELINES ACCORDINGLY: NWC

While it is extending its guidelines, the NWC said the circumstances of many employers would have changed “significantly” compared with last year.

“All employers should re-evaluate their business situation and how the NWC guidelines would apply to them,” it said, while urging employers of unionised companies to share relevant information, such as company performance and business prospects, with the unions to facilitate wage negotiation.

For instance, employers that have done well and have good business prospects should continue to reward employees fairly through variable payments, and bring forward their hiring plans. These employers should also grant built-in basic wage increases, the council said.

For businesses seeing a recovery, they should restore wage cuts implemented earlier or roll back other cost-saving measures such as reductions in allowances and commissions. Those that have reduced basic wages should also restore these wages first, followed by the variable wage components.

As for those that continue to be badly hit by the pandemic, the NWC urged them to continue tapping on government support measures to accelerate business and workforce transformation, retain employees through appropriate cost-saving measures, as well as retrain and redeploy employees in affected business units to new jobs within the company.

If they still face significant cost pressure and poor business prospects after exhausting non-wage cost saving measures and support from the Government, they “should seek employees’ support to implement temporary wage cuts to minimise retrenchments” based on key principles in the supplementary guidelines, the NWC added.

These include the immediate implementation of the flexible wage structure - a fixed basic wage together with monthly and annual variable components - for those who have not done so, by treating any wage cuts as adjustments to a new variable component.

Unionised companies should also negotiate and agree on wage adjustments, other cost-saving measures and the implementation of the flexible wage structure, the NWC's addendum said.

In a statement expressing support for the guidelines, National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) president Mary Liew said “workers in different sectors have different expectations on their wages depending on how their industry performs”.

Ms Liew, who is also an NWC member, also called on employers to “as far as possible, endeavour to pay employees the annual wage supplement”. Doing so will help employees with seasonal expenses during a challenging period, especially for the low-wage workers.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATION FOR LOW-WAGE WORKERS

The NWC said it continues to call on all employers to “give special consideration” to low-wage workers.

To uplift wages for this group of workers, it recommends employers who have done well, or are recovering, to consider built-in wage increments. Employers who are implementing wage reductions should also implement a wage freeze for low-wage workers instead.

The NWC is also working with the tripartite workgroup on lower-wage workers, which will be releasing its recommendations later this year on how to cover more low-wage workers under the progressive wage model.

“The NWC aims to incorporate the (tripartite workgroup’s) recommendations … into the 2021/2022 guidelines,” it said.

Speaking at the same press conference, the labour movement’s deputy secretary-general Koh Poh Koon said low-wage workers are a vulnerable group that has borne a larger share of the pandemic's impact.

“So a principle we want to emphasise is that this group of workers should be the last to get any cuts, and the first to get any restoration or increment”, he said, adding that there is already a significant wage gap between those in the bottom 20 per cent and the rest of the workforce.

“This is the time for us to actually play catch-up and not have them lag behind even further.”

The Government said it has accepted the NWC’s recommendation to extend its guidelines, and will continue to work with tripartite partners “to secure the rebound and support businesses and workers to emerge stronger” from the COVID-19.

The Manpower Ministry’s permanent secretary Aubeck Kam said the current guidelines “already build in a lot of flexibility to deal with a whole range of scenarios”.

“By and large if you look at the record of last year, employers and workers worked very well together to protect jobs – you see that in the strength and resilience of local employment numbers,” Mr Kam told reporters at the press conference.

“I think that’s a good sign. It shows that the recommendations and guidelines that were handed out last year are quite effective and fit for purpose.”

ON FLEXIBLE WAGE SYSTEM

The Government, in its media statement, also said it encourages every employer to implement the flexible wage system if they have not done so.

This system will give them the “necessary flexibility” to navigate economic uncertainty, increase job security for employees and ensure that wages are fairly and more quickly restored in tandem with eventual business recovery, it added.

Singapore National Employers’ Federation (SNEF) president Robert Yap said more will have to be done to nudge employers to take on the flexible wage system, which can act “as a cushion for ups and downs”.

Only 29.3 per cent of workers here were employed by companies using the system up until 2019 and the figure “has not increased a lot” since then, he added.

“More emphasis needs to be done, together with the union, to make companies truly adopt the flexible wage system so that we can then withstand all these shocks and we know, that ups and downs are going to be more frequent,” said Mr Yap, who is a NWC member.

NTUC's Ms Liew said the unions will continue to work with its partners on this. So far, one in every two unionised companies have a variable wage component for their employees’ salaries."
Hawker centre diners who do not clear their tables face fines from Sep 1,"The National Environment Agency (NEA) will take enforcement action against diners at hawker centres who leave dirty trays, crockery and litter on their tables from Sep 1, the agency said on Friday (May 14).

First-time offenders will receive a written warning. Second-time offenders will face a composition fine of S$300, while subsequent offenders may face court fines, said NEA.

AdvertisementAdvertisement
To help diners familiarise and adjust to the new measures, this will be preceded by a three-month advisory period from Jun 1 to Aug 31.

No enforcement action will be taken during the advisory period. Safe distancing ambassadors, SG Clean ambassadors, community volunteers and NEA officers will remind diners to clear their tables. Visual cues such as posters and banners will be installed as reminders, said NEA.

The agency is also setting up more tray return infrastructure across all hawker centres to support diners.

ENFORCEMENT FROM SEPTEMBER

From Sep 1, enforcement officers will continue to advise diners to clear their tables. Officers will then take action against diners who do not heed their advice.

The Singapore Food Agency will also work with NEA to progressively roll out enforcement at coffee shops and food courts in the fourth quarter of the year.

Advertisement
NEA is not enacting a new law for the enforcement action, as leaving litter on dining tables is enforceable as a littering offence under the Environmental Public Health Act, said the agency.

However, NEA will take a pragmatic posture, such as enforcing against diners who do not heed advice by enforcement officers to clear their dirty trays, crockery and litter after dining, it added.

In response to queries from CNA, the agency said the advisory period for table littering will remain from Jun 1 to Aug 31. This takes into account the suspension of dining-in from Sunday through Jun 13.

NEA said it will continue to monitor the situation on the ground and will introduce further adjustments if needed, to be in line with prevailing measures to minimise the transmission of COVID-19.  

PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS, PAST EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS

The enforcement action follows extensive educational efforts over the years to change the behaviour and mindsets of diners, including the launch of the Clean Tables Campaign in February, said NEA.

Clearing the table shows consideration for the next diner, and allows cleaners to focus on the most important task of cleaning and disinfecting tables, said the agency.

The self-service approach is also a more sustainable way of keeping dining places safe and clean, it said.

This is especially given the tight cleaning workforce comprising a majority of seniors who may be more vulnerable to diseases such as COVID-19.

NEA said that the pandemic has underscored the need for all to maintain high public hygiene and cleanliness standards.

Various members of the public and institutions, such as the Public Hygiene Council, have called for stronger levers including legislation to raise table cleanliness standards at public dining places, it said.

The average tray and crockery return rate has seen only a nominal improvement from 33 per cent to 35 per cent after the Clean Tables Campaign was launched, said NEA.

This was despite 76 per cent of respondents in a survey conducted by NEA in March indicating that they return their trays and dirty crockery most of the time.

This shows that actual practice on the ground does not match up with individual espoused behaviour, said the agency.

With only slight improvements being achieved thus far after much effort on education and outreach, a stepped-up advisory and enforcement approach will help raise our public hygiene standards at public dining places, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

These efforts will help Singapore to transition to a more socially conscious, self-service concept where diners clear their dirty trays, crockery and litter, and leave behind a clean table for the next patron, said NEA.

This will allow us to enjoy our meals in a clean and hygienic environment and better safeguard ourselves against any public health risks."
F&B businesses to get more support from Jobs Support Scheme following tighter COVID-19 measures,"The Government will increase support for F&B businesses under the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) to 50 per cent, following the announcement that dining-in will be suspended from Sunday (May 16). 

This is an increase from the 10 per cent support of wages paid up to June 2021.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
Speaking at media conference on Friday, co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force Lawrence Wong said: “We realise that this will have significant inconvenience to many people, I think the businesses that will be hardest hit will be the F&B sector because of the restriction for dining-in.” 

This increase in support will apply during the period where dining-in is prohibited, he added. 

The current size of group gatherings allowed will be reduced from five people to two people, following a spike in COVID-19 community cases, Mr Wong announced on Friday. 

Dining-in at F&B establishments will not be allowed. This includes hawker centres and food courts, both indoors and outdoors.

AdvertisementAdvertisement
The measures will be in place for a month between May 16 and Jun 13, and the Government will do a review two weeks after they have been implemented to “look at the prevailing public health situation” and “see if there’s a need to adjust the measures further”, said Mr Wong. 

In a separate press release, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said that the Government will increase the JSS support rate to 50 per cent of the first S$4,600 of gross monthly wages paid to local employees for this period. 

“This is an increase from the 10 per cent support for wages paid up to June 2021,” the press release stated.
Advertisement
The Government will also provide one month of rental waivers for hawker stalls and coffee shop tenants of government agencies, said Mr Wong. 

“We also strongly encourage commercial landlords to support their F&B tenants,” he added. 

Responding to whether the Government expects the fallout for F&B businesses to be comparable or worse than during the “circuit breaker” period last year, Mr Wong said it would be “hard to predict”. 

“Certainly the F&B sector will be impacted. The takeout business is not the same as dining-in. And therefore, while they can shift to take out, there will be an impact on the revenues and bottom lines.

“We will continue to monitor this closely but we believe with the support measures we can do something to help the affected businesses.” 

The JSS was first introduced in the Budget in February 2020, and it subsidised between 25 and 75 per cent of wages for firms. 

During his Budget speech earlier this year, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat announced a fourth extension of the scheme, costing the Government another S$700 million.

Enhanced COVID-19 safe management measures for nightlife establishments pivoting to F&B operations,"Singapore is stepping up enforcement of COVID-19 safe management measures to ensure compliance by nightlife operators who have pivoted to the food and beverage industry.

This is because breaches by such establishments are flagrant and carry much higher public health risks, said the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) on Friday (May 14).
AdvertisementAdvertisement
With effect from May, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) will revoke the food licences of non-compliant former nightlife operators in the F&B industry who commit egregious breaches of safe management measures.

Establishments that lose their food licence must cease operations with immediate effect until the nightlife sector is allowed to reopen, or until their reapplication for a new food licence is approved, said MSE.

Nightlife operators that intend to operate F&B establishments must file a change of use application, with immediate effect, with the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) to obtain planning permission to convert their premises.

They must submit a proposed business concept or operational details, a layout plan showing usage of the premises and plans to remove any bar-related signages or paraphernalia for URA's assessment.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
Nightlife operators who received URA's earlier endorsement to temporarily pivot to F&B operations must now apply for change of use by the end of the one-year validity of these endorsements, said MSE.

Nightlife establishments can continue to apply for a grant of up to S$50,000 from Enterprise Singapore to defray qualifying costs incurred during the change of use process. The support is available until Sep 30.

MSE added that government agencies will also take other enforcement measures within their regulatory ambit, such as revoking the public entertainment licence or liquor licence.

MORE THAN 400 NIGHTLIFE OPERATORS PIVOTED

Nightlife establishments including bars, clubs, discos and karaoke lounges have not been allowed to operate in their original form since March last year, but have been able to temporarily pivot to F&B businesses since October.

To date, 406 nightlife operators have received SFA's food shop or snack counter licence and temporarily pivoted to F&B operations, said MSE.

However, some establishments continue to operate nightlife activities that are currently prohibited and flagrantly flout safe management measures in the process, said MSE.

These breaches include failing to prevent large groups of patrons from intermingling, employing hostesses and allowing live entertainment and games.

The vast majority of repeated egregious breaches have been committed by recently pivoted nightlife establishments, said MSE.

The ministry listed nine of such nightlife establishments that have been caught at least twice for egregious breaches: MZS Family Karaoke, Club Peaches, Club One Min, Club Mao by Barcode, The Drinks Emporium, Hooha Restaurant & Cafe, Cheers Up, Alive @ Sg Pub and Destiny Japanese KTV.

Safe management measures must be strictly adhered to, otherwise we could well face a resurgence of community transmission which will disrupt our lives and livelihoods, said MSE.

We have seen how nightlife activities in other countries have led to super spreader events. We must all do our part to prevent this from occurring in Singapore, the ministry added.

Singapore on Friday announced tighter measures to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus in the community, including a reduction of the limit on group sizes from five to two people.

Dining-in at F&B establishments will also not be allowed under the new measures, which will be in place from May 16 through Jun 13.

MORE F&B OUTLETS CLOSED, FINED FOR BREACHES

Government agencies have ordered 10 F&B outlets to close over breaches of safe management measures, said MSE.

Six of them are nightlife operators which have pivoted to F&B operations.

They include Destiny Japanese KTV at Cuppage Plaza, which failed to minimise interaction between staff and customers on May 7. As the establishment is a repeat offender, it has been ordered to close for 30 days from May 8.

MZS Family Karaoke at Ming Arcade allowed customers to consume alcohol after 10.30pm on May 8. As a repeat offender, it has been ordered to close for 20 days from May 9.

Three more establishments were ordered to close for 10 days each.

Club Illusion and English Football Museum at River Valley Road allowed intermingling between groups of customers and gatherings of more than eight people on Apr 23. Club Illusion will be temporarily closed from May 6 while English Football Museum will temporarily suspend operations from May 8.

Haru at Central Mall allowed gatherings of more than eight people on May 7. URA has ordered it to temporarily close from May 9.

THIRTY PEOPLE FINED AT PARKS AND BEACHES

Thirty people have been fined for breaching safe management measures at parks and beaches managed by the National Parks Board (NParks) on May 8, including gathering in groups of more than five.

All water play areas and water recreational facilities in NParks-managed parks and gardens are closed until May 30 in line with tightened measures to minimise interactions in the community, said MSE.

NParks will also temporarily close access to some parks, sections of beaches and facilities such as shelters and car parks when these areas get too crowded, added the ministry.

Referring to an incident last week in which two men from a group of six diners at Lau Pa Sat used abusive language against safe distancing enforcement officers and a safe distancing ambassador, MSE said that the Government takes a serious view of abuse of safe distancing personnel and will take firm action.

(Safe distancing enforcement officers and safe distancing ambassadors) have been working hard to keep our community safe. They are performing an important duty, said the ministry.

We urge members of the public to continue to cooperate with them and comply with the instructions of personnel deployed for COVID-19-related duties.

"Public transport can be 'very safe' if commuters keep their masks on and refrain from talking, says transport minister","While there might be “transient” crowding at certain train stations, public transport is “very safe” if commuters refrain from talking and keep their masks on, said Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung on Friday (May 14).

He was responding to a reporter’s question on possible measures to limit crowds in public transport during a press conference by the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force.

The transport minister said: “Be assured that the air ventilation within the train is actually very good. Excluding the opening and closing of train doors, every six minutes, all the air is being replenished.”

He added that until Friday's announcements of the latest measures, commuter volumes have been at around 70 per cent of pre-pandemic levels. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) said the figure has dropped to about 40 per cent for central business district journeys by train.

The LTA has been monitoring crowding on trains, and observed that crowding usually happens at a particular station at a certain time, dispersing once the train reaches the next station.

“So with good ventilation ... (if commuters) refrain from talking, keep your mask on, and LTA and the public transport operators running the train frequencies normally like pre-COVID, I think we can keep public transport very safe,” said Mr Ong.

Singapore-Hong Kong travel bubble may be delayed; decision by early next week: Ong Ye Kung,"Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung said on Friday (May 14) that Singapore will critically review the start date of the air travel bubble between Singapore and Hong Kong, given Singapore's rising number of COVID-19 cases. 

The assessment is: Given the rising cases in Singapore, it is very likely that Singapore will not be able to meet the resumption criteria, said Mr Ong at a COVID-19 multi-ministry task force press conference on Friday. 
AdvertisementAdvertisement
What we'll do now is closely monitor the numbers next few days, critically review the start date and early next week, we will make a decision and make an announcement on the Singapore, Hong Kong air travel bubble.

Mr Ong said he had spoken to Hong Kong's secretary for commerce and economic development Edward Yau on Friday morning to brief him on Singapore's COVID-19 situation. 

We both agree that we are strongly committed to do this air travel bubble between these two international cities, said Mr Ong. 
AdvertisementAdvertisement
But at the same time we have to start it safely. And we must respect the resumption mechanism that both sides have agreed on.

On Thursday, Singapore reported 24 new COVID-19 community cases among 34 new infections. It was the highest number of community cases here since Jul 11, 2020. 

Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased from 48 cases in the week before to 71 cases in the past week, said MOH. The number of unlinked cases in the community has increased from seven cases in the week before to 15 cases in the past week.

Under the terms of the agreement, the Singapore-Hong Kong travel bubble will be suspended for at least 14 days if the seven-day moving average of unlinked local COVID-19 cases a day, excluding dormitory resident cases in Singapore, is more than five in either Singapore or Hong Kong.

Mr Ong added that Hong Kong is a very safe region now.

Like us, they do tens of thousands of tests a day and they are picking up often zero if not one, two cases a day, he said. The issue now is the situation in Singapore where cases are going up. 

The air travel bubble was slated for launch last November, but was suspended after a rise in coronavirus cases in Hong Kong. The resumption of the travel bubble was announced on Apr 26 before community cases began rising in Singapore.

Additional COVID-19 antigen rapid testing to be rolled out for people with symptoms,"To speed up the detection of COVID-19 cases, rapid antigen testing (ART) will be conducted on all individuals who seek treatment with symptoms, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong on Friday (May 14). 

This is on top of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests that are being conducted on all people with possible COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms, or the loss of smell or taste.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
The additional testing will apply to all individuals with such symptoms who go to Public Health Preparedness Clinics with the Swab and Send Home programme, polyclinics, emergency departments and regional swab centres.

“While the ART is less accurate than the PCR test, and there will be more false positives and false negatives, the ART’s quicker turnaround time compared to a PCR test will allow us to take any public health actions more quickly for persons who test positive by ART,” said the Ministry of Health (MOH).

Test results from ART tests take typically around 30 minutes, but it can take up to 48 hours for PCR tests, as the samples have to be sent to laboratories to be tested.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
Both the ART and PCR tests will be funded by the Government for all who present themselves with ARI symptoms, said MOH.

This comes amid a recent rise in COVID-19 cases within the community, with some unlinked cases, clusters at Changi Airport and Tan Tock Seng Hospital, as well as cases detected in schools.

Mr Gan, who was speaking at the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force press conference, said that the ART will allow infections to be detected more quickly so that the authorities can start contact tracing. Close contacts of infected cases can also be quarantined earlier.

If there are false positive we can verify with PCR but in the meantime, once we have a positive result from reality, we can start the contact tracing and ring fencing and quarantine of close contacts that will allow us a head start in terms of our ring fencing of the infection, he said. 

He urged those with symptoms to come forward as soon as possible.

Even if we are able to shorten the testing time, if the patients only present themselves to healthcare institutions one or two days later, that negates the entire effort of trying to shorten the testing period, he said.

However, as this type of testing is not as accurate as PCR tests, both have to be done to ultimately confirm the infection, Mr Gan added.

Director of medical services Kenneth Mak also said that MOH is working with the laboratories to expand their capacity in case Singapore needs to ramp up testing. 

We are also working to expand our quarantine facility capacity in order to be able to accommodate the potential and future demands associated with bringing all these clusters under control, he said.

UPDATE ON VACCINATION

In an update on Friday, MOH said Singapore has administered more than 3.2 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines.

About 1.9 million individuals have received at least one dose of the vaccine. Among them, about 1.3 million have received their second dose.

“The recent cases illustrate that vaccination may not eliminate the risks of infection completely. However, it provides significant protection against infections and helps to reduce the severity of the disease and onward transmission,” said MOH. 

It added that vaccination remains a “key enabler” and its ability to help Singapore reopen safely can only be felt when a high level of vaccination coverage in the population is achieved. 

“We urge everyone to be vaccinated when it is offered to you. Observe all safe management measures, see a doctor, and get tested if you feel unwell,” said the ministry.

FACE SHIELDS

MOH also updated its safe management advice to restrict the use of face shields.

It said that research has demonstrated that face shields cannot substitute masks in protecting the wearer from droplet infection, and do not adequately prevent prevent droplet spread if the wearer is infected. 

“Face shields should therefore not be used as a substitute for mask wear, except for medical exceptions; or where the child is 12 years or younger; or for the marriage couple during the solemnisation of their marriage,” it said.

"Group sizes down from 5 to 2, dining-in suspended as Singapore tightens COVID-19 measures","The current size of group gatherings allowed will be reduced from five people to two people, following a spike in COVID-19 community cases, said co-chair of the multi-ministry task force Lawrence Wong on Friday (May 14). 

This, and other new measures under what the Health Ministry labelled as Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) will take effect from May 16 through Jun 13.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
Speaking at a multi-ministry task force press conference on Friday, Mr Wong said: “This will apply across the board, so if you want to go out for anything, grocery shopping, exercise, maximum of two persons henceforth. 

“In fact, we strongly encourage everyone to stay home as much as possible, go out only for essential reasons.

“We will do a review at the midway point, meaning two weeks after the measures have been implemented, and at that point, we will look at the prevailing public health situation and see if there’s a need to adjust the measures further,” said Mr Wong, who is also Education Minister.

Responding to questions about whether Singapore could enter another “circuit breaker” after the midpoint review, Mr Wong said: “If indeed the situation does not improve, we certainly will not rule out even more stringent measures thereafter. 
AdvertisementAdvertisement
“But there is also a chance that things may improve, and therefore, we may also consider the other way around, easing some of the restrictions.” 

“We are in a stage of heightened alert. I would urge everyone to be vigilant and minimise unnecessary social interactions,” said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong. 

“We need to act decisively to disrupt the virus transmission. We will therefore further tighten safe management measures in the community”

DINING-IN SUSPENDED, WORK-FROM-HOME AS DEFAULT

Dining-in at F&B establishments will also not be allowed, said Mr Wong. This includes hawker centres and food courts, both indoors and outdoors.

“We will take tighter measures around the higher-risk settings, and these higher-risk settings are the ones where people are gathered together in an indoor environment without their mask on,” said Mr Wong. 

“All dining-in will have to cease … All F&B establishments will only be able to offer takeaway and delivery options. In line with this, wedding banquets will also have to cease because it’s a dining activity.” 

Working from home will also be the default at workplaces, he added. “All employees who are able to work from home will have to do so. Work-from-home will be the default.” 

The cap of five distinct visitors per household per day will also be reduced to two distinct visitors per household per day, Mr Wong said. 

“Individuals should continue to limit their overall number of social gatherings to not more than two per day, whether to another household, or meeting with friends and family members in a public place,” said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a separate press release. 

Grandchildren being cared for by their grandparents on a daily basis would not count towards the cap of two distinct visitors or the number of social gatherings per day, said MOH in the press release. 

“However, grandparents are strongly encouraged to be vaccinated against COVID-19, to protect both themselves and their grandchildren from COVID-19 infection. To reduce the risk of transmission, grandparents should also minimise intermingling between grandchildren from different households,” said the Health Ministry. 

Other activities that will not be allowed during this period include strenuous indoor exercise classes, or strenuous individual and group indoor sports and exercise activities, said MOH in the press release. 

Personalised services that need masks to be removed like facials and saunas, singing and playing instruments that need “require intentional expulsion of air” like wind or brass instruments, will also not be allowed. However, medical and dental services can continue, the press release noted. 

EVENT SIZES AND PRE-EVENT TESTING

Event sizes and event size caps will be further scaled down, said Mr Wong. 

Currently, events can have 100 attendees without pre-event testing and 250 with pre-event testing. This will be scaled down to 50 and 100 attendees respectively, he added. 

This will apply to congregational and other worship services and MICE activities, said Mr Wong. 

“Likewise, we will reduce the capacity limits across the board for shopping malls, showrooms and attractions, as well as cruises, museums, public libraries, all of these capacity limits will be scaled back,” he added. 

For congregational and other worship services, religious workers and all other participants must wear their masks at all times “to further mitigate the risk of spread through aerosol transmissions”, said MOH in the press release. 

Live singing and playing of wind instruments will also be suspended during this period. 

The operating capacity of attractions that have received prior approval from the Ministry of Trade and Industry will be reduced to 25 per cent from the current 50 per cent. Museums and public libraries will also be allowed to operate at a reduced capacity of 25 per cent. Indoor and outdoor shows can proceed with up to 100 people with pre-event testing and up to 50 without, said MOH. 

This also applies to cinemas, but the group size of two people applies. Food and beverages also cannot be sold or consumed in the cinema. The cap for funeral attendees will also be reduced from the current 30 people to 20 people, said MOH in the press release.

Marriage solemnisations will be allowed to continue, with a cap of 50 and 100 attendees without and with pre-event testing respectively, the press release read. 

“We know that there is one group who will be particularly impacted too, which are wedding couples. Some of them may already have wedding plans for this coming Sunday, and it may be very hard to make last-minute changes,” said Mr Wong. 

For affected couples, the Government is “prepared to consider grandfathering the arrangement” for couples who have already made plans for Sunday, he added. 

“They can proceed, but we will require them to put in place pre-event testing for all their guests. But this is a special arrangement only for this Sunday because this is a once in a lifetime event for the wedding couples.” 

The measures announced on Friday are “already very stringent”, said Mr Wong. “If everyone cooperates and we all do our part, we will be able to bring down the latest clusters and cases and bring the infection under control.” 

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said separately on Friday that people in Singapore should stay at home as far as possible and go out only for essential tasks as well as follow government advisories. 

If you do go out, remember to practise safe distancing measures, like using TraceTogether and wearing a mask, he said in a Facebook post.

The new clusters and unlinked community cases in the past fortnight are very worrying. We are testing more intensively, and doing our utmost to ring-fence the transmissions. But we also need stricter restrictions to stop more cases from popping up.

Mr Lee also urged members of the public to get vaccinated in order to protect themselves and their loved ones. 

The new measures will be difficult for everybody. But if we all play our part and look out for one another, we will succeed in stemming the transmission of the virus, just like we did last year, he added.

Several students who tested positive for COVID-19 linked to private tutor at tuition centre: MOH,"Several students who have tested positive for COVID-19 are linked to a private tutor at a tuition centre, said the Ministry of Health’s (MOH) director of medical services Kenneth Mak on Friday (May 14).

Speaking at a COVID-19 multi-ministry task force press conference, Assoc Prof Mak said that the students were picked up as part of epidemiological investigations and testing while being placed under quarantine.

The tutor, known as Case 63131, is a 50-year-old Singaporean woman who works as a private tutor at Learning Point.

She developed diarrhoea and a headache on May 3, a fever on May 6 and cough on May 11. She sought medical treatment at a general practitioner clinic on May 11 and was tested for COVID-19. Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day. Her serology test result is pending, said MOH on Thursday.

All infections of school-going children have happened outside of the school, said Education Minister Lawrence Wong on Friday.

“We have a series of very tight measures to pick up and to detect and to ring-fence our school system,” he said.

“For example, the first ring of defence will be the close contacts, and then the second ring will include, if necessary, swabs of everyone in the school - staff and students,” he said, adding that the Government has done this in Edgefield Secondary School and Victoria Junior College.

Both schools have had a student test positive for COVID-19.

“Up to now, there is no evidence of transmission within the school system, he said.

However, Mr Wong said that the Government will continue to monitor the situation closely and see if additional measures are required, after having tightened safe management measures in schools.

On Thursday, the Ministry of Education said that a student at Yio Chu Kang Primary School contracted COVID-19. 

Two more primary schools are also conducting home-based learning from Friday after COVID-19 cases were reported among its student population. 

According to notices seen by CNA, two students from Kong Hwa School and a student from St Andrew's Junior School tested positive for COVID-19. 

USING FACE SHIELDS

All teachers will no longer be allowed to wear face shields instead of surgical masks while teaching, said Mr Wong. 

He was responding to a question on whether the private tutor had been wearing a face shield instead of a mask while conducting her lessons.

All the schools will adopt a similar posture which is that we will no longer use face shields as a substitute for mask wearing, he said, although he noted that the vast majority of teachers had already been using masks.???????

TAN TOCK SENG HOSPITAL CLUSTER

One more case was reported for the Tan Tock Seng Hospital cluster, bringing the total number of cases under this cluster to 44, said Assoc Prof Mak.

The patient was in quarantine, and there have not been any cases reported outside of the quarantine net for close contacts associated with the Ward 9D cluster, he added.

“We are reaching one incubation period and if we continue not to see any other cases beyond those that are already in quarantine, we may work with the hospital subsequently to see how to bring the hospital back to normal operations progressively over the next few weeks,” he said.

YIO CHU KANG PRIMARY SCHOOL STUDENT TESTS POSITIVE FOR COVID-19

On Thursday, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said Yio Chu Kang Primary School will conduct home-based learning for three days after one of its students tested positive for COVID-19. 

MOH has determined that the student's COVID-19 infection was not school-based, as he was infected by a household member.

The student was last in school on Monday, and he was well at the time. However, he was unwell the next day and consulted a doctor.

Yio Chu Kang Primary School has already cleaned and disinfected its premises thoroughly, and MOH has placed students and staff who were in close contact with the student on a quarantine order from May 12 to May 24.

Victoria Junior College will resume physical classes on Monday after all students, staff members and vendors tested negative for COVID-19.

The school shifted to full home-based learning on May 10 after one of its students contracted COVID-19.

Migrant worker who had COVID-19 admits loitering around Changi Airport in bid to take flight home,"A 26-year-old migrant worker who suspected he had COVID-19 failed to stay at the hospital as directed, and instead took public transport to Changi Airport where he loitered for hours hoping to get a flight home.

Indian national Parthiban Balachandran pleaded guilty on Friday (May 14) to a charge each of exposing others to the risk of COVID-19 infection and leaving an isolation area without permission. 
AdvertisementAdvertisement
Another two charges of exposing others to the risk of infection and of using insulting words towards a health officer will be considered in sentencing.

The court heard that Parthiban stayed at Jurong Penjuru dormitory, which was among the dorms declared in April 2020 to be an isolation area.

On May 23 last year, Parthiban reported sick at the dorm, complaining of a fever and sore throat. Based on his symptoms and knowing that other dorm residents had reported positive for COVID-19, Parthiban suspected that he was infected with the virus.

He was taken to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) by ambulance where a swab test was taken from him. He was transferred to a fever-screening area in the hospital's multi-storey car park, where staff nurses briefed him repeatedly in English and Tamil not to leave until his test results were ready, and not to go anywhere unless instructed. 
AdvertisementAdvertisement
He was also told not to leave so that he would not risk infecting others if he did have COVID-19.

Swab test results later showed he was a confirmed COVID-19 case.

At about 5.30pm the same day, Parthiban left the hospital without informing anyone, intending to go the airport to buy a ticket and return to India immediately. 

Closed-circuit television footage showed him leaving with two bags, walking towards Kim Tian Road and crossing an overhead bridge. He walked to Yong Siak Street, where he took a bus and later flagged a cab at Lower Delta Road.

He took the taxi to Changi Airport Terminal 1, where he spoke to airport staff and tried to buy a ticket to India. He was not sold a ticket, and loitered at the airport for about four hours until the police found him and escorted him back to SGH.

The taxi driver who took him to the airport was issued a quarantine order for 14 days and could not work during this time. He tested negative for the virus.

Parthiban completed his period of isolation in the hospital on Jun 8 last year and was diagnosed to be no longer infectious. He was sent back to the dormitory and ordered to serve another 14 days' leave of absence, and was not allowed to leave the dorm.

HE LEFT THE DORMITORY FOR THE AIRPORT BEFORE TIME WAS UP AGAIN

On Jun 16, before the period was up, Parthiban packed two bags of belongings and left the dorm. He intended to leave Singapore as he knew many dorm residents had tested positive for COVID-19.

He took a cab to the airport but was told by airport staff that he could not buy a ticket. He loitered at the airport and slept there, before heading to a relative's home in Tampines the next day.

He told his relative that he had left the dorm without permission only after entering the flat. His relative called his employer and the police escorted him back to the dormitory.

In a charge taken into consideration, Parthiban also used insulting words at a Ministry of Health officer at Harbourfront Centre on Oct 14 last year. When the officer read a charge to him, he said in Tamil: Who are you both to charge me? Are you a judge?  

Other things he said were: What rights do you have to charge me?, Have you read law? Or do you have proper education to charge me?.

He also said to the officer: I have BABL (Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Law). Do you have a law degree in the first place? Do you want to see my degree?

The prosecutor is asking for the maximum six months' jail for Parthiban. Defence lawyer Cory Wong of Invictus Law, who took the case on pro bono, asked the judge to remand Parthiban at the Institute of Mental Health for psychiatric observation.

DEFENCE ASKS FOR PSYCHIATRIC OBSERVATION

He tendered a Jun 8, 2020 memo from SGH indicating that Parthiban was suffering from adjustment disorder close to the time of the offences. He said Parthiban was on medication in April this year and was admitted to IMH last month. 

He said Parthiban was limited by his financial means, explaining why no psychiatric report was obtained earlier. 

As far as we understand, the prosecution is asking for the maximum six-month jail term. Even with the COVID situation now ... we urge the court to exercise some caution and compassion, so we have all the relevant facts before we proceed with sentencing, said Mr Wong. He said the remand would be to assess if Parthiban had any mental condition at the time of the offences and if there was any link between this and the offences.

The judge initially had reservations, saying the courts usually order IMH remand only at the charging or initial stages of cases.

However, after considering further and after the prosecutor said he did not object, the judge ordered Parthiban to be remanded at IMH for psychiatric observation.

Parties will return in June for further hearings. 

The maximum penalties for exposing others to the risk of infection are six months' jail, a S$10,000 fine, or both."

Singtel said on Friday (May 14) it had begun a strategic review to consider options for digital marketing firm Amobee and cybersecurity business Trustwave.

Singtel said it expected to record net exceptional losses of S$1.21 billion in its full-year results, mostly due to impairment of assets and goodwill at the two businesses.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
Singtel has been facing slowing growth in its traditional carrier business and has been trying for years to diversify in new sectors.

It bought US-based Amobee for US$321 million (S$428 million) in 2012 and completed the acquisition of Trustwave at a reduced price of US$770 million in 2016.

The review marks the first major overhaul since Yuen Kuan Moon took over as CEO in January.

This review could involve the restructuring of product or business segments, a full or partial divestment or business combinations with other industry players, Moon said.

We are open to all types of strategic partnerships and deals including inviting investors who have complementary capabilities and can enhance the value of the businesses.

The company said it had booked an impairment charge of S$589 million on Amobee and S$336 million on Trustwave in the second half of the year.

The remaining carrying values of Amobee and Trustwave will be S$511 million and S$695 million respectively, the company said in a bourse filing.

Singtel also expects a S$204 million impairment charge on Australian telco Optus mainly due to legacy fixed access networks that will no longer be used.

This follows the completion of Australia's National Broadband Network roll-out and subsequent migration of customers.

A review of staff compensation at Optus is expected to record another exceptional charge of S$101 million.

The charges will be partially offset by exceptional gains including an estimated S$98 million arising from dilution in Singtel's effective shareholding in Indian telco Bharti Airtel from 31.9 per cent to 31.7 per cent, after shares were issued by Airtel as partial consideration for the acquisition of equity interest in Bharti Telemedia in March 2021.

Singtel will release its second-half and annual results on May 27."

The list excludes residences, workplaces, healthcare facilities and public transport.

Those identified as close contacts of confirmed cases would have been notified by MOH.

As a precautionary measure, people who were at these locations during the specified timings should monitor their health closely for 14 days from the date of their visit.

They should see a doctor promptly if they develop symptoms of acute respiratory infection (such as cough, sore throat and runny nose), as well as fever and loss of taste or smell, and inform the doctor of their exposure history, said the ministry.

There is no need to avoid places where confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been, added MOH.

The National Environment Agency will engage the management of affected premises to provide guidance on cleaning and disinfection.

Singapore reported a total of 34 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday. Twenty-four of those cases are in the community, with nineteen linked to the Changi Airport cluster.

Visitors with travel history to Vietnam to serve 21-day stay-home notice at dedicated facilities,"Visitors with recent travel history to Vietnam will have to serve a 21-day stay-home notice at dedicated facilities, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Thursday (May 13).

Previously, travellers were required to serve 14 days of their stay-home notice at a dedicated facility and an additional seven days at a place of residence or self-sourced accommodation.

The change is due to a recent increase in COVID-19 cases reported by Vietnam, and takes place with immediate effect, MOH said in a press release.

Travellers who have not completed their 14-day stay-home notice at a dedicated facility by 11.59pm on May 15 will have to serve the additional seven days at their current facility. They will be contacted regarding the additional costs to be paid.

To minimise movement and risk of transmission, those currently serving their stay-home notice at a place of residence or self-sourced accommodation will be required to complete their 21-day stay-home notice at their current location.

Travellers serving 21-day stay-home notices will undergo COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests on arrival, day 14 of their stay-home notice and before the end of the 21-day period.

Travellers from Fiji are still allowed to serve the additional 7-days at their place of residence, MOH said.

Vietnam reported its first community COVID-19 case in more than a month on Apr 29, with other clusters emerging since.

Commentary: Five pandemic lessons we have learnt that should tide us over any surge in cases,"How the tides have turned. Only a month ago, Singapore had just relaxed its COVID-19 restrictions, allowing more to return to offices and attend events.

Crowds were thronging shopping malls and attractions. Plans were made for staycations and gatherings. Masks were more often worn revealing noses.  
AdvertisementAdvertisement
Call it COVID-19 fatigue, the setting in of complacency in our safety measures of mandatory mask-wearing and venue-capacity controls, we were all happy to have some semblance of normalcy as Singapore reopened.

Then on Apr 29, what a shock. The reported locally transmitted cases in Singapore leapt to 16.

After being used to zero or low single-digit daily community cases for what seemed like the longest time, we all felt unsettled. We went about our daily lives wondering if this could be a blip and if the cases might just peter out in the next few days.

They didn't.

Co-chair of the multi-ministry task force Gan Kim Yong warned of the “concerning” B16172 COVID-19 variant first detected in India on Tuesday (May 11), while Lawrence Wong highlighted that Singapore was on a “knife’s edge”, with community cases going either ways, after an outbreak of clusters related to Changi Airport and Tan Tock Seng Hospital

SCALING DOWN ACTIVITIES
Advertisement
Earlier last week, Singapore tightened COVID-19 restrictions to return to Phase 2 after an uptick in daily new infection numbers.

When I read the announcement, I sighed and then went on to cancel a facial appointment and told friends whom I had made plans to meet up with that we ought to postpone. All my friends agreed it was the right thing to do.

My younger daughter in Primary 3, due to go for a learning journey with her school later in May, was disappointed when I told her the excursion was likely to be cancelled. 

The Ministry of Education had announced from May 8, safety measures in schools will be strengthened and this included the suspension of activities in public spaces such as learning journeys.

The frustration at the turn in events was apparent on my social media. Friends lamented over having to revert to home workouts as gyms closed, keeping their kids home for the coming weekends and no more dining-out together for those with more than five in a family.

The complaints were reminiscent of when Singapore had to tighten measures last year in response to rising community cases, but the tone seem different.

We are taking it in our stride. There is an air of ”okay, this sucks but we can do this”.

Having been through the circuit breaker last year, we all know what to expect.

Whether the situation improves or deteriorates in the coming weeks, now is a good time to recap five key lessons picked up over the past year that will get us through the next little while.

LESSON 1: PRACTISE GOOD HYGIENE

If COVID-19 has taught us only one thing, I hope we have better hygiene practices.

After constant reminders from posters, TV, radio and ubiquitous bottles of hand sanitisers, washing our hands frequently, avoiding touching our faces and staying home when one is sick ought to be ingrained in all of us.  

I dream of the day when we no longer have to witness unhygienic actions like people coughing openly into the air or food handlers talking over our food.

I hope Singaporeans will be considerate enough to voluntarily wear facemasks when unwell and use serving spoons at communal meals after COVID-19 is long over.

However, I fear this may be a lofty wish. Even during the pandemic, we have already heard of people avoiding seeing doctors and going to work despite being sick.

Some are already wearing facemasks as “chin masks” away from the gaze of enforcement officers.

The recent rise in COVID-19 cases in Singapore is proof of how this pandemic is still fluid. The good hygiene practices and civil-mindedness we were forced to pick up might just be what we need to prevent a worsening of the current COVID-19 situation or the next deadly pandemic.

LESSON 2: BE KIND

One thing that has surprised me this pandemic is the kindness I have seen.

People left extra tips and bought food for delivery riders, gave free treats to frontline and migrant workers, and enthusiastically supported local businesses and attractions.

The pandemic brought out a better appreciation of people and things we took for granted in our harried lives.

The kindness we have extended and experienced will go some way to get us through this tough period. After all, delivery riders are still braving weather elements to bring us our purchases. Healthcare workers are still working tirelessly at the frontlines. Migrant workers who left their homes to work in Singapore are still building our country’s infrastructure.

The feeling of “we’re all in this together” may have sparked the enthusiastic response, but let’s not allow this kindness to vanish when the COVID-19 situation no longer feels dire. As a society, we are always in this together.

How have taxi drivers coped since COVID-19 hit our shores? Two gentlemen give their honest take on how it's been going in CNA's Heart of the Matter.

LESSON 3: FIND PLEASURE IN THE SIMPLE JOYS

Pre-COVID-19, my weekends with my husband and two daughters were often spent in a rush as we packed our time with activities like birthday parties, playdates and visiting new playgrounds.

But COVID-19 forced us to slow down and stay home. We picked up new hobbies: My children learned to make stop-motion videos, my husband found time to read while I dabbled in new recipes.

I remember during the circuit break how my social media was filled with photos of beautifully-plated cuisine by friends who became masterchefs and indoor games concocted by creative parents to keep their kids occupied. I still see many friends keeping up with their new hobbies which has sparked new levels of creativity and joy.

For me, I saw my father a lot more after he started working from home, looking over his small business. He is a man of few words but our lunches together give us the opportunity to talk about anything. 

My children have also taken to asking their grandparents about their lives and childhoods a lot more over these frequent meals together.

My family still chooses to stay in and take it slow on some weekends. COVID-19 has sparked an appreciation of the simple joys in our life. We have come to realise we do not have to be out and about all the time.

LESSON 4: STAY FLEXIBLE AT WORK

Over this past year, we have made good use of technology be it for working from home, home-based learning or holding online events.

Sure, it took some getting used to initially and there were teething problems like technical glitches. But by now, so many have become adept with technology and new practices. I am genuinely impressed by how schools are using Zoom for lessons, parent-teacher meetings and assembly book talks by authors.

The move back to Phase 2 is proof that our work practices need to remain flexible, and hybrid working arrangements should become a norm.

After all, improved productivity and employee morale — be it from saving on commuting time, waking later or avoiding office distractions — are often-cited advantage to continue work-from-home arrangements.

We also don’t know how long this pandemic will last. Being able to have people work from home when cases go up or clusters in offices emerge is a necessary option.

This pandemic might just be the opportunity for us to evolve with times and change practices for the better.

LESSON 5: DO OUR PART AS INDIVIDUALS

In the coming weeks, I intend to play my part by minimising socialising and not going out unless necessary.

I am also bracing myself for home-based learning with my kids as there is no telling if things could worsen and another round of circuit break is required.

But this time, I know my mentality will be different: We have been through this and we can get through it.

And when things truly get better, I hope the lessons we learned from this pandemic stick with us.

It could well make the difference in whether our lives can go back to normal and whether we emerge from this as a stronger country and as more resilient individuals.

There are 150 cases still in hospital. Most of them are stable or improving, and three are in critical condition in the intensive care unit. Another 243 are being isolated and cared for at community facilities.

As of Thursday, Singapore has reported a total of 61,453 COVID-19 cases and 31 fatalities.

FREE TESTING FOR PEOPLE WHO VISITED T3

The Health Ministry announced on Wednesday that it would offer free COVID-19 testing for people who had visited Changi Airport Terminal 3 from May 3 onwards. 

Based on further epidemiological findings, we will extend free COVID-19 testing for those who had visited Changi Airport Terminal 3 from May 1 onwards, MOH said in an update on Thursday. 

All visitors to Changi Airport Terminal 1 and Jewel from May 1 onwards are also advised to monitor their health closely for 14 days from their date of visit, MOH added. 

They are strongly encouraged to visit a Regional Screening Centre or Swab and Send Home Public Health Preparedness Clinic for a free COVID-19 test if they feel unwell.

Jewel Changi Airport as well as Terminals 1 and 3 will be also closed to members of the public from Thursday for 14 days.

All workers in the three buildings have been undergoing mandatory COVID-19 tests in a special testing operation that began on Sunday. Terminal 2 has been closed since May 1, 2020.

Changi Airport remains open for air travel during this period. Passengers may also continue to be dropped off and picked up from the airport.

The real deal on air-frying: Is it that much healthier than deep-frying food?,"Can you have fried food without feeling guilty, knowing that it is unhealthy?

This is what manufacturers of air fryers promise — great-tasting food with minimal fat. Some even claim a fat reduction of up to 90 per cent as air-frying does not require oil.

And people are buying into it. The global air fryer market is expected to reach US$1.18 billion (S$1.56 billion) in size by 2026, up from US$680 million in 2019, according to brand and consulting firm KBV Research.

Air-frying involves creating and circulating hot air to “quickly cook the surface layer” of food and “quickly dry it out” for that fried, crunchy texture, noted food scientist Zhou Weibiao.

Adding just a “touch” of oil can “bring the air-fried food closer to the deep-fried one” — minus the calories — said the professor, who heads the National University of Singapore’s Department of Food Science and Technology.

But caloric intake aside, how much healthier is air-fried food?

To find out, the programme Talking Point selected three everyday foods: Chicken wings, selar kuning (yellow-banded scad, the fish that often accompanies nasi lemak) and French fries.

One set was air-fried, the other was deep-fried, and both sets were tested for saturated fats, trans fats and cholesterol.

The laboratory test results showed that the air-fried chicken wings had 38 per cent less saturated fats than the deep-fried version, while the air-fried selar kuning and chips had about 53 per cent less saturated fats.

The air-fried chicken wings also had 55 per cent less trans fats and 25 per cent less cholesterol than the deep-fried version.

There was little to no difference, however, in trans fat levels between the air-fried and deep-fried versions of selar kuning and French fries.

Nutritionist Carolyn Stephen of Singapore Polytechnic’s Food Innovation and Resource Centre attributed this to the fact that the fish and potatoes had little trans fat in the first place.

As for cholesterol levels, there was only a 1 per cent difference between the two versions of selar kuning. Fish is naturally low in cholesterol, she noted, while potatoes “don’t have cholesterol because it’s a plant-based food”.

THE ACRYLAMIDE TEST

The chips were also tested for acrylamide, a chemical that forms when certain types of starchy foods, such as potatoes and bread, are cooked at high temperatures. That includes the frying process.

Research has suggested that acrylamide in food has the potential to cause cancer. And in February, tests carried out by the Hong Kong Consumer Council found acrylamide in the chips fried in various models of air fryers.

The levels ranged between 102 micrograms (?g) per kilo and 7,038 ?g/kg, with samples from six of the 12 air fryer models containing acrylamide that exceeded the European Union benchmark of 500 ?g/kg.

For the Talking Point samples, the test results showed a huge spike in acrylamide: The deep-fried potatoes contained less than 10 ?g/kg, but the air-fried ones contained 1,400 ?g/kg.

WATCH: Is air-fried food really healthier? (22:05)

Stephen said she understands if this “raises some concern”. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has described acrylamide as a health concern, although she noted the caveat that the evidence on “what’s safe and what’s not safe” in humans is “lacking”.

“A lot of studies that have been done in the area of acrylamide have been based on lab animals,” she said.

The WHO has called for more long-term studies of acrylamide levels in food and the risk exposure. Accordingly, Singapore has not yet established a regulatory benchmark for acrylamide intake, she noted.

On its website, the Singapore Food Agency states that the information available so far “reinforces general advice on healthy eating, including moderating consumption of fried and fatty foods”.

To reduce the build-up of acrylamide, Philips Asean Pacific personal health leader Nicholas Lee said consumers should also take note of three factors: Cooking time (not too long), cooking temperature and preparation.

Talking Point host Sharda Harrison had air-fried her potatoes for 14 minutes at 200 degrees Celsius, while the deep-fried version was on medium to high heat for eight minutes. Lee, however, recommended cooking them at 180° Celsius “or slightly below”.

“If you’re cooking fresh potatoes, 160 (degrees) for the first part and then 180 (degrees) for the second part … would reduce the quantity of acrylamide that forms,” he said.

As for the preparation, soaking potatoes before frying them was one of his tips. “That’ll remove a lot of the starch and … sugar content (which) influence the formation of acrylamide,” he said. “It actually makes the fries taste better.”

He advised against storing potatoes in the fridge at very low temperatures, which would increase the sugar content and therefore the amount of acrylamide.

Consumers can also avoid overcooking by sticking to “that golden brown texture that you’re looking for in beautiful, home-made fries”, he added. Darker crusts indicate higher acrylamide levels.

AIR-FRIED HAWKER FOOD?

As a cooking option at home, air-frying may be increasing in popularity — one brand in Singapore saw air fryer sales grow by 50 per cent between 2019 and last year — but eating out is a different matter.

Industrial-grade air fryers are not readily available, nor are Singapore’s hawkers putting air-fried dishes on the menu.

It is not for lack of demand — a 2017 Nielsen online survey showed that 74 per cent of Singaporean respondents were willing to pay more for foods that promote health benefits.

Not all foods, however, are suitable for air-frying, said blogger Erinna Chng, who was previously hired by a leading brand to try out air fryer-friendly recipes.

Dishes fried in batter, such as Indian rojak and banana fritters, would “create a mess in the air fryer” as it does not have the oil to “set the batter”.

“I think western (food) stalls that mainly use frozen pre-fried food would be suitable for (air-frying); for example, if they cook the fries in the air fryer, it would help to drain the oil,” she added.

“Air fryers actually work for stalls that don’t totally depend on frying. For example, nasi lemak stalls (could) air-fry their chicken wings and fish. The wonton noodle (stalls) can pre-cook their fried wontons beforehand and … reheat using the air fryer.”

To put theory to the test, Kong Chee Chiew, assistant general manager of Fatty Bom Bom’s chain of western food stalls, agreed to offer air-fried versions of three side dishes.

Using three air fryers with the biggest capacity Talking Point could find, his team air-fried roasted wing sticks, Cajun wings and Cajun onion rings for lunch.

At the end of the one-hour experiment, most of the diners who tried the items enjoyed the taste and said they would love the air-fried dishes to be permanent options on the menu.

Kong does not think it is possible, however, to completely switch from deep-fried to air-fried meals one day. “Customers normally don’t want to wait too long (at) lunchtime,” he said. “(The air fryer) is slow … (and) too small.”

But he would consider air-frying if bigger, industrial-size air fryers that can handle a high volume of orders were available.

Until then, said Harrison, citing the health benefits, “I’ll just have to air-fry at home when I’m craving for something deep-fried”.

"Stricter COVID-19 rules a setback, but indoor playground Kiztopia still set on expanding","A day after it was announced that the limit on social gatherings will be cut from eight people to five, indoor playground operator Kiztopia began receiving enquiries from customers who needed to make alternative plans for their children’s birthday celebrations.   

Around 40 bookings were affected by the stricter COVID-19 rules that will be in place until May 30 to curb the recent rise in community infections.

AdvertisementAdvertisement
So far, 10 reservations will proceed with a reduced party size. Others are considering shifting their bookings to next month or cancelling altogether, said founder and chief executive officer Heidi Tian.

The tightened safety measures come as Kiztopia is gearing up for an expansion.

AdvertisementAdvertisement
The indoor attraction, which targets young children from two to 12 years old with themed play zones, its own edutainment content and mascot characters, is opening two new playgrounds at Jurong and Punggol.

Also set to kick off this month are activities to mark its second anniversary, including a special ticketed indoor playground at Downtown East and a nightly light show at its Marina Square outlet that will last for about six weeks.

It declined to reveal how much it has invested into these new plans, and would only say that the 6,000 goodie bags it prepared for the light show already cost more than S$100,000.

“To be very honest, it's a little setback because we have been working hard to get everything ready … and maybe at this juncture, the market will not react,” said Ms Tian, although she stressed that she understands and is supportive of the stricter restrictions.

“From the experience last year, such scenarios need to be tackled quickly and efficiently so it is a good thing that the Government is (taking) action right when the cases are increasing … and I think for better reasons like controlling the situation before the June holidays,” she added.

“I think it is quite timely to have stricter rules for now … We are still observing the situation but overall, I am keeping positive.”

STAYING AFLOAT

Having a glass-half-full mentality is one of the things that Ms Tian, 45, has learned after more than a year of running a business under uncertainties brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The former banker with two children founded Kiztopia in June 2019 after noticing a gap in the market here, as indoor playgrounds tend to be small set-ups in malls meant as pit-stops during shopping.

Spanning 18,000 sq ft at Marina Square, Kiztopia was the biggest playground located inside a shopping mall when it opened in June 2019. Apart from different play zones, party rooms and a stage area for performances, it also has a cafe for parents to relax while their children play.

The business did “really well” soon after it opened, recalled Ms Tian, so much so that the team was scouting for locations to expand by the end of the year.

Then the coronavirus pandemic hit at the start of 2020.

By February, visitorship was down by two-thirds as parents kept their children away from crowded public places. Caution largely persisted in March before all indoor playgrounds were ordered to be shut towards the end of the month as part of COVID-19 control measures.

“The big environment was really against us and every day went further south,” said Ms Tian.

The closure, which lasted until mid-July, was a difficult period for the first-time entrepreneur.

“I was previously working in a bank where the job environment is quite safe but after becoming an entrepreneur, you start thinking a lot more,” she told CNA in an interview

“Will your customers forget about you? What about staff morale? Are we going to survive at all? What am I going to do if this shuts down? A lot of things to think about but I try to keep positive.”

So the business went online.

It set up shop on e-commerce platforms like Lazada and Qoo10 for customers to purchase entry tickets and merchandise.

It also started producing videos featuring its 11 original mascot characters. Uploaded on its own YouTube channel, these range from art and craft ideas, song and dance, to its own animation series.

“During the months where we (were closed), we were not relaxed at all. The team created online content, and came up with a solid workflow and SOPs (standard operating procedures),” said Ms Tian.

“We used that four months to strengthen many of our foundations so that’s why once we open, we can hit the ground running.”

Ms Tian also described the Jobs Support Scheme, a wage subsidy scheme launched by the Government at the start of the pandemic, as a “big help”. “Without that, we probably would have failed,” she said.

The sprawling indoor playground at Marina Square now operates with a capacity limit capped at 40 per cent, admitting visitors at three-hour intervals. In between these sessions, which visitors have to book online in advance, the entire site is cleaned and disinfected.

Employees are also stationed at each zone to manage the crowd and ensure safe distancing.

These efforts helped to build up confidence and business has slowly returned with parents keen to bring their children out to play and celebrate special occasions, said Ms Tian.

EXPANSION

Moving forward, Kiztopia is set to open a 4,500 sq ft playground in Jurong Point on May 28, followed by another 5,500 sq ft space in Punggol in July.

The aim is to venture into the heartlands where its customers are but given that these are much smaller spaces, they will be launched under a sub-brand called Kiztopia Club.

“Because people are used to us being a big space so if we branched into the neighbourhood with the same name, people might get confused or even have negative feelings,” explained Ms Tian.

“We are not sacrificing the quality but with a smaller space, we will have to be a compact version of our usual offerings,” she added, noting that the new locations will still feature multiple play zones, function rooms, cafes and gift shops.

While the turn in the COVID-19 situation of late has been “a little” unexpected, Kiztopia said it has no plans to rejig its expansion plans. It has since hired about 10 more full-timers for the new playgrounds.

Asked where she sees opportunities, Ms Tian said: “Some players have closed down so that creates a better opportunity for us ... especially to launch in the neighbourhoods and be closer to our customers. I think Singapore still has room for us to grow a few more outlets.”

There are also opportunities with its original characters, which can “be embedded into many different products and services”, she added.

These can be in the form of merchandise and even online educational content. The company has also been approached by other businesses on collaborations, although it declined to reveal the specifics.

The Kiztopia founder likened her journey as an entrepreneur thus far to her time in the banking industry during the global financial crisis.

“That was like a once in a lifetime experience,” she said. “Looking back, this has also been quite an exciting journey.”

Despite the stress, many other opportunities have emerged.

“It has been a bumpy (ride) but there have been opportunities that in the past may never come to us. Now, either because someone has left the market or we have demonstrated that we are very resilient, the door has opened up to us,” said Ms Tian.

“So I really try to keep positive.”

Commentary: Why do some children choose unhealthy food when they get older?,"We breathe a sigh of relief seeing our children enter primary school. Gone are the days of dealing with fussy eating and agonising over what they eat.

Just as we think our children’s eating habits are stabilising and that we have it all under control, they transit through another stage of life – a stage where they have a growing appetite for independence and want to make personal decisions on their food and activities.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
Convincing our children to listen and adhere to advice on eating healthily, being more physically active and having less screen time becomes incredibly challenging.

What’s more, with them spending a large proportion of time out-of-home, we find ourselves struggling to be fully aware of their activities and have less control of what they choose to consume or do.

Two years ago, my team and I conducted focus group discussions with 55 primary school children, aged nine to 12. We gleaned some invaluable insights into how they think and act when it comes to food.

AdvertisementAdvertisement
In general, all the children we interviewed demonstrated a good understanding of healthy eating and were able to share why it is important.

The tricky thing was that having this knowledge did not necessarily translate into consistent healthy eating behaviours. While a few children tried to adhere to a healthy diet, many felt that the consequences of unhealthy food wasn’t really a big concern.

Instead, food and taste preferences appeared to be the key factors determining food choices.
Advertisement
Existing research bears that out - children’s food intake intentions and behaviours tend to be influenced by habitual responses and emotional factors such as whether the food is pleasant, enjoyable or disgusting, and less by cognitive persuasion.

This is likely because children have yet to develop the cognitive abilities to understand concepts like nutrition, health and care much less about how it will affect them in the future.

PARENTS ARE CRITICAL ROLE MODELS

One thing that came up quite clearly is how much children look up to parents as role models.

Some recounted that their parents would talk to them about healthy eating and reinforced their advice by providing healthy meals at home (such as using healthier cooking methods and preparing vegetables and fruits) and ensuring well-balanced meals when eating out.

Others mentioned that their parents would reprimand or scare them, to get them to eat certain healthy foods. Some of the children also expressed displeasure at their parents’ constant nagging at them to consume fruits and vegetables, yet didn’t eat these themselves.

Several described that their parents would forbid the storage of “junk foods” at home. But these less healthy foods would be provided as rewards when children engaged in physical activities or consumed vegetables.

In response to the strict restrictions, a few children said they did all this appease their parents, while some chose to consume the restricted foods in secrecy.

Practices like these often do not teach children how to self-regulate their food consumption. Instead, they undermine a child’s perceived importance of adherence to healthy eating and lead to increased preference of the less healthy reward foods.

OUTSIDE INFLUENCES: TEACHERS AND SOCIAL MEDIA

Having heard what children said in our focus groups, I appreciate even more the health education lessons, the Healthy School Meals programme in schools, and the important role teachers play in reinforcing healthy behaviors - things we often taken for granted.

The children were aware that fruits and vegetables were mandatory for all meals sold in schools, although some alluded to only eating the fruits and vegetables prepared in ways they preferred, for example vegetables stir-fried with garlic and seasoning instead of simply boiled, fruits cut and bagged up rather than placed on the same plate beside the main meal.

Besides learning about healthy eating as part of the school curriculum, some children spoke of how their teachers would monitor their intakes during recess time and snack time.

This showed the importance of ensuring consistency of healthy eating messages across home and school, as conflicting ones may confuse children and hinder their ability to make prudent dietary choices.

Then there is the potent impact of social media and advertising. The children we interviewed revealed that while they were aware of health promotion posters in and around their schools, the advertisements on online platforms were the ones that often captured their attention.

For example, one student cited the video advertisement from the Let’s Beat Diabetes campaign as one that left a lasting impression and even tried re-enacting it.

At this age, children are still cognitively immature and are particularly open to messaging from advertisements and social media.

More can be done to engage online social media platforms frequented by children, to deliver health promotional messages, to positively influence their food choices, and at the same time, counter-balance the marketing appeal of less healthy foods.

THE TIME-STARVED FAMILY

We also spoke to parents and many of them shared the immense challenges they faced when instilling healthy eating habits in their children.

The lack of time and skill to prepare healthy food means they too struggle to have a balanced diet for themselves and their family. Having to juggle multiple responsibilities of work and supervision of multiple aspects of their children’s life (including studies, screen time and physical activity) means that at times, something has to give. 

This may mean having to eat out more frequently or order in take-aways, which sometimes end up being fast-foods.

Some also mentioned that grandparents’ or their spouses’ dietary preference for less healthy food often undermine their own efforts in being good role models for their children.

Despite these challenges, families can do their best. One way is to get children involved in the food preparation process. It can be helping with the cooking, going grocery shopping and even being exposed to urban farming and gardening.

Studies show such activities increase children’s willingness to try new foods, being aware of different fruits and vegetables and these translate into positive dietary behaviours.

While it is important to constantly provide good incentives to get kids to eat healthier, the practice of imposing too strict a restriction on less healthy foods can sometimes backfire, as it may increase a child’s desire to consume these foods, and may even contribute to dysregulated eating behaviors in the long-term, studies have shown.

Teaching children self-regulate their food consumption by providing guidance and routines, setting limits, and considering the child's perspectives are much better alternatives. 

Balancing healthier meals during the weekdays with some weekend takeaways or occasional fast-food treats make a good compromise.

Children are at the life stage of developing attitudes and values, so influencing them to adopt healthy lifestyle behaviours become important. These efforts may be tedious and challenging but will pay off as healthy taste preferences and eating habits established during childhood go a long way into adulthood.

As the African proverb goes: “It takes a village to raise a child.” It is clear that efforts from parents alone are not enough, but synergy with schools and the community at large will be required, so that our next generation can not only eat better, but live healthier lives too.

Commentary: Flaring tempers and public incidents – are we losing it because of COVID-19?,"COVID-19 has robbed us of our sense of control.

We have had to adapt to changes forced upon us. From learning how to spend entire days with family to dealing with not seeing family and friends for entire months, to figuring out how to work from home and avoid working non-stop, work and life norms have swung from one pendulum to another.

We also have had to deal with mental health challenges, in tackling Zoom fatigue to finding alone time in a house filled with people and learning how to draw work-life boundaries and redefine rest.

Then you step outside your house to find a new set of challenges await. This ranges from the logistical (how to take public transport while touching the least possible number of surfaces) to the behavioural (how to keep your distance from people).

RECLAIMING CONTROL
AdvertisementAdvertisement
Psychologists know this desire to reclaim power over our situations is not new. We have taken actions to manage small incidents of stress in our everyday lives long before the advent of COVID-19.

When I come to a traffic light junction, I press the “green man” button. When I am in a hurry, I unconsciously press it more than once. If I am in a great hurry, I tap on it many times.

I am not entirely sure if the button works. It is probably a placebo button. But pressing it makes me feel better about my waiting. It gives me a comforting sense of control.

But we can’t control the uncle standing too close to us in a hawker centre queue.

Neither can commuters on a MRT train control a 39-year-old maskless man who, in a viral video last weekend, was bent on debating strangers and sharing his personal research on the science of COVID-19 rather than mask up.

The safe distancing ambassador at Lau Pa Sat might not have predicted how people can lose their cool when he confronted groups he suspected of flouting rules.

Online, these two pieces of news have been met with swift condemnation and people calling for harsh punishments – fines, jail and even caning or deportation - to be meted out right away. It seems tempers are flaring all around.

Why are people reacting like that? Are we losing our grip?

While the police investigate the cases that have come to light, we hope justice will be meted out to show violence and flagrant flouting of rules is not acceptable.  

THE SAME BOAT, THE SAME GROUP

COVID-19 has imposed greater uncertainty over most parts of our lives. We have also lost control over our fate and our independent selves so it’s little wonder our tempers have grown short and our patience wearing thin.

In order to exit the current COVID-19 measures, return to phase 3 and avoid personal illness, we need others (people, organisations and the Government) to cooperate and make the “right decisions”.

This is our shared fate. Everyone in Singapore is now reluctantly in the same boat and in the same group. We are finding out we need the cooperation of others, including our neighbours, domestic helpers, and the general public around us whom we never had to rely on so critically before for our fate.

The trouble is people enter COVID-19 with diverse values and tolerance levels. And this could explain why some react badly to being confronted. 

Our group isn’t from a Hollywood movie script. We are not going to win the basketball tournament or charge forward and overrun the enemy line as one united team.

Our group has probably never been this tested on our social cohesion. We may have differences that span age, race, gender and even nationality, when members comprise those from the Merdeka generation aunties to working adults juggling work and family, to migrant workers.

Our group also has what psychologists call low task cohesion: We don’t fully agree on what needs to be done and how they should be done. For example, some believe that we should close our borders, while some caution against it.

And yet, our group is facing a big challenge in wanting everyone to conform to norms and rules to keep everyone safe. We depend on others to follow the new COVID-19 social norms of mask wearing, maintaining social distance, and avoiding large gatherings.

Group members who commit indiscretions must know they are creating an unequal hierarchy, with themselves at the very top. With offences holding the potential of starting another wave of COVID-19 infections, offenders have unequal power over the fates of law abiding, norm-following members of the group.

A similar rationale applies to netizens condemning these two incidents and calling for punishments to be meted out before justice has a chance to take its course. We need group members to reciprocate. We might think “I hate wearing a mask but I’ve worn one all day. Why can’t these people wear their masks properly too?”

Proponents of harsher actions may see these offenders as group members who violate our social norms and do not match our sacrifices.

(Are COVID-19 vaccines still effective against new variants? And could these increase the risk of reinfection? Experts explain why COVID-19 could become a “chronic problem on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast.)

 

AGGRESSIVE CALLS CAN SPIN OUT OF CONTROL

It is no surprise then to see more reports of aggressive reactions to COVID-19 restrictions on one hand, and calls for stiffer punishments for COVID-19 restriction violations on the other. People are desperate to reclaim personal control.

And attempts to stop them, such as when they go out for a gathering of more than five at Lau Pau Sat, may be met with anger. “Who are you to ask me to listen to you?” shouted a man when his larger-than-five group is confronted by a safe distancing ambassador. Kudos to the ambassador who strove to keep his cool.

Yet let’s not forget sentiments of intolerance can spin out of control quickly. We have witnessed the rise of anti-Asian hate crimes elsewhere in the world. 

In Singapore, our anger and frustration with COVID-19 and its outcomes and restrictions can easily morph into xenophobia and the formation of group identities based on adherence to rules.

While not representative of all Singaporeans, social media comments related to foreigners seemingly violating COVID-19 restrictions or entering into Singapore from high-risks countries reveal a deep sense of anti-foreigner sentiments among some in our community.

My research with 280 Singaporeans found that xenophobic fears related to COVID-19, evident through responses to questions such as “If I was in an elevator with a group of foreigners, I’d be worried that they’re infected with the virus”, is only second to danger and contamination fears about COVID-19, evident through responses to questions such as “I am worried that I can’t keep my family safe from the virus”.

These two fears were higher among my Singaporean participants than fears about the socio-economic consequences of COVID-19.

There is a story of how hot water changes things differently, revealing what one could be made of. In hot water, a hard potato softens, an egg is transformed but it’s the coffee bean that changes the hot water.

COVID-19 is that hot water challenging our national character.

It would be tragic if one legacy of COVID-19 is fear, discrimination against foreigners and knee-jerk reactions to cases of infractions.

NParks landscaper who tested positive for COVID-19 linked to Changi Airport cluster,"SINGAPORE: A National Parks Board (NParks) landscaper who tested positive for COVID-19 last week has been linked to the COVID-19 cluster at Changi Airport, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Wednesday (May 12).

Epidemiological investigations showed that Case 63005, an NParks landscaper who was confirmed to have COVID-19 on May 8, had been at Changi Airport Terminal 3 on May 3 and May 4.

He visited the same locations as Cases 62940 and 62942 - a cleaner and safety coordinator who work at Terminal 3 - during their infectious period.

He was likely to have been infected while he was at Changi Airport Terminal 3, said MOH.

Seven new community cases reported on Wednesday were also linked to the cluster. Of these, three tested primarily positive for the B1617 variant that was first detected in India, said MOH.

SEVEN NEW CASES

The first case, Case 63091, is a 24-year-old Singaporean man who is employed by Huawei Enterprise as an IT engineer.

He works at Changi Airport Terminal 4, but had been at Terminal 3 on Apr 28 and May 3. He had not gone to work after the onset of symptoms.

He developed a fever on May 7, which subsided on the same day with self-medication, MOH said. His fever returned the following night and he resolved it with self-medication again.

On May 9, he sought medical help at a general practitioner clinic and was diagnosed with tonsillitis. He developed a fever later on the same day and sought treatment at another GP clinic that evening.

He was tested for COVID-19 at the clinic and confirmed to have COVID-19 on May 11. His serology test result is pending.

The second case, Case 63094, is a 39-year-old Singaporean who works as an Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officer at Changi Airport Terminal 3.

He is asymptomatic and was detected when he was tested on May 9 as part of rostered routine testing.

His pooled test result came back positive for COVID-19 the next day, and he was taken to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on May 10, where an individual test was done. He was confirmed to have COVID-19 the next day.

His earlier tests from rostered routine testing – the last being on Apr 12  – were all negative for COVID-19 infection. 

His serology test result is negative for the N antigen, which suggests the presence of early infection. 

Case 63094 received his first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine on Jan 17, and the second dose on Feb 7. He has tested preliminarily positive for the B1617 variant, and is pending further confirmatory tests.

The third case, Case 63095, is a 38-year-old Singaporean woman who works as an ICA officer at Changi Airport Terminal 3. She was also detected as part of rostered routine testing on May 9. 

Her pooled test result came back positive for COVID-19 the next day and she was taken to NCID on the same day, where an individual test was done. 

Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 on May 11. She developed a runny nose on the same day.

Her earlier tests from rostered routine testing – the last being on Apr 15 – were all negative. Her serology test result is negative for the N antigen, which suggests the presence of early infection. 

Case 63095 received her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on Jan 30, and the second dose on Feb 20. She has also tested preliminarily positive for the B1617 variant, and is pending further confirmatory tests.

The fourth case, Case 63097, is a 62-year-old Singaporean man who is employed by Ramky Cleantech Services as a cleaner and trolley handler at Changi Airport Terminal 3.

He had been identified as a contact of Case 62940 - a 47-year-old cleaner who is also employed by the same company and works at Terminal 3 - and placed on quarantine on May 8.

FREE COVID-19 TESTING

Amid the rise in cases in the Changi Airport cluster, MOH will offer free COVID-19 testing for members of the public who had visited Terminal 3 from May 3 onwards.

The ministry will inform affected individuals through SMS on how they can book an appointment for their test.

It also advised all visitors to Terminal 1 and Jewel Changi Airport from May 3 onwards to monitor their health closely for 14 days from their date of visit.

They are strongly encouraged to visit a regional screening centre or 'swab and send home' public health preparedness clinic for a free COVID-19 test if they feel unwell, MOH added.

The first infection in the cluster at Changi Airport was detected on May 5, when an 88-year-old man who works as a cleaner at Terminal 3 tested positive for the disease.

The cluster has since expanded to include the family members and household contacts of earlier cases who work at the airport.

A Victoria Junior College student who tested positive for the virus on May 7 has also since been linked to the Changi Airport cluster.

She had visited the Kopitiam food court at Changi Airport Terminal 3 on May 3, the same day as two other cases in the cluster, said MOH in an update on her case on Tuesday.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and Changi Airport Group (CAG) said last Sunday that all workers in Changi Airport’s operating terminals will be tested for COVID-19 in a special testing operation.

About 9,000 workers from Terminal 1, Terminal 3 and Jewel Changi Airport will undergo these tests. Terminal 2 is not open.

While the special testing operation is ongoing, the passenger terminal buildings will be closed to the public from May 13 to May 27, said CAAS and CAG on Wednesday.

Only passengers with air tickets and essential airport workers will be able to access the passenger terminals during this period.

Jewel Changi Airport will also be closed for 14 days, they said.

We urge all airport workers as well as staff working in Jewel to refrain from going out except for essential work or activities for the next 14 days, MOH said on Wednesday.

They should also not be redeployed to other workplaces or outlets during this period.

As of Wednesday, Singapore has reported a total of 61,419 COVID-19 cases and 31 fatalities.

The list excludes residences, workplaces, healthcare facilities and public transport.

Those identified as close contacts of confirmed cases would have been notified by MOH.

As a precautionary measure, individuals who were at these locations during the specified timings should monitor their health closely for 14 days from the date of their visit.

They should see a doctor promptly if they develop symptoms of acute respiratory infection (such as cough, sore throat and runny nose), as well as fever and loss of taste or smell, and inform the doctor of their exposure history, said the ministry.

There is no need to avoid places where confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been, added MOH.

The National Environment Agency will engage the management of affected premises to provide guidance on cleaning and disinfection.

Singapore reported a total of 16 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday. Ten of those cases are in the community, with seven linked to the Changi Airport cluster. 

A National Parks Board (NParks) landscaper who tested positive for COVID-19 last week has also been linked to the Changi Airport cluster.

He had been at Terminal 3 on May 3 and May 4, and had visited the same locations as two other cases.

Police warn of new scam advertising fake jobs for e-commerce platforms,"A new scam trend has surfaced, where scammers offer fake part-time jobs for e-commerce platforms, said the police on Wednesday (May 12).

The fake advertisements are posted on Facebook, or sent via unsolicited WhatsApp messages from unknown numbers.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
The scammers would offer part-time jobs such as an affiliate marketing associate, with a daily salary of between S$300 to S$500. The message would also include a WhatsApp number as a point of contact to sign up for the job. 

If victims contact the number, the scammer would then explain that the job requires them to help e-commerce platform merchants improve their sales by making advance purchases. Victims would be assured that they would get their money refunded eventually, plus a 10 per cent commission.

The scammers would then provide an e-commerce platform item link to the victims, and instruct them to provide a screenshot of the item in their shopping cart.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
The victims would then be instructed to make payment for the item by transferring the money to a bank account number provided by the scammer. 
Advertisement
This process would be repeated several times, beginning with low cost items, before progressing to more expensive items. 

Victims would initially receive the refunds and the commission, but the scammers would eventually claim to have encountered issues with refunds, and stop paying the victims.

The scammers would then become uncontactable.

The police would like to advise the members of public to adopt the following precautionary measures:

If it is too good to be true, it probably is. Do not accept dubious job offers that offer lucrative returns for minimal effort

Always complete your purchase on the e-commerce platform itself. Avoid making advance payments or direct bank transfers to the seller as this method does not offer any protection

Never share your bank account details with anyone. Your personal bank account is for your own usage and you are responsible for all transactions made through your bank account.

Those with information related to such crimes can call the police hotline at 1800-255-0000, or submit it online at www.police.gov.sg/iwitness.

For more information on scams, members of the public can visit www.scamalert.sg or call the anti-scam hotline at 1800-722-6688. "
Singapore calls for de-escalation of violence in Israel and Gaza,"Singapore on Wednesday (May 12) said it is extremely concerned about the civilian casualties from the escalation of violence in Israel and Gaza, and called on all parties to cease attacks on civilian targets.

We strongly urge all sides to take immediate steps to de-escalate the situation and work towards a durable ceasefire, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).

MFA advised Singaporeans in Israel to stay indoors as far as possible and avoid unnecessary travel, especially to areas where attacks are occurring.

They should also be on high alert and monitor the news closely, as well as take the necessary precautions for their personal safety, it said.

Singaporeans in Israel should also eRegister with the ministry if they have not done so, so as to allow MFA and the Honorary Consulate-General in Tel Aviv to contact them and render consular services in case of emergencies.

"Jewel Changi Airport, Terminals 1 and 3 to be closed to public as COVID-19 testing continues","Jewel Changi Airport as well as Terminals 1 and 3 will be closed to members of the public from Thursday (May 13) for 14 days amid a rise in the number of cases linked to the airport.

All workers in Terminals 1 and 3, as well as Jewel Changi Airport have been undergoing mandatory COVID-19 tests in a special testing operation that began on Sunday. Terminal 2 has been closed since May 1, 2020.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
While the special testing operation is ongoing, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and Changi Airport Group (CAG) said on Wednesday that the passenger terminals buildings will be closed to members of the public from Thursday.

As a precaution, passenger terminal buildings will be reopened 14 days later on May 27. Jewel will also be closed for 14 days, said the authorities.

Changi Airport remains open for air travel during this period, said CAAS and CAG, adding that passengers may also continue to be dropped off and picked up from the airport.

“Access to the passenger terminal buildings will be restricted to only passengers with air tickets and essential airport workers, said the authorities.

Some essential services and food and beverage outlets will remain open to serve them. For clarity, members of the public will not be allowed to enter the passenger terminal buildings.

FREE TESTING FOR PEOPLE WHO VISITED T3

In a daily COVID-19 update on Wednesday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said it will offer free testing for members of the public who had visited Terminal 3 from May 3 onwards.
Advertisement
This is to pre-emptively mitigate any potential risk of wider, undetected community transmission, said the Health Ministry.

MOH will progressively inform these individuals via SMS notification with information on how to book an appointment for their test, it added.

All visitors to Terminal 1 and Jewel from May 3 onwards are also advised to monitor their health closely for 14 days from their date of visit. 

They are strongly encouraged to visit a regional screening centre or Swab and Send Home Public Health Preparedness Clinic for a free COVID-19 test if they feel unwell, added MOH.

REFRAIN FROM GOING OUT

CAG said last week that about 9,000 workers from Terminal 1, Terminal 3 and Jewel Changi Airport will undergo COVID-19 testing.

All vaccinated frontline airport workers who had earlier been tested every 28 days will now be tested every 14 days as part of rostered routine testing.

“We urge all airport workers as well as staff working in Jewel to refrain from going out except for essential work or activities for the next 14 days or until they have been tested negative for COVID-19. They should also not be redeployed to other workplaces or outlets during this period, said CAAS and CAG.

Given the evolving nature of COVID-19, we will continue to review and adjust the measures as necessary, including extending the closure if required.

CAAS and CAG said aviation workers will continue to do their best to secure Singapore’s borders while ensuring that Singapore stays connected to the world even during the pandemic.

CHANGI AIRPORT CLUSTER GROWS

Seven new infections reported on Wednesday were linked to the Changi Airport COVID-19 cluster, which now includes household contacts and family members of previous cases.

The first infection in the cluster was detected on May 5, when an 88-year-old man who works as a cleaner at Terminal 3 tested positive.

A Victoria Junior College student who tested positive for the virus on May 7 was on Tuesday linked to the Changi Airport cluster.

The student had visited the Kopitiam food court at Changi Airport Terminal 3 on May 3, the same day as two other cases in the Changi Airport cluster, said MOH on Tuesday.

A landscaper working at NParks has also been linked to the COVID-19 cluster at Changi Airport. Epidemiological investigations showed that the man, who was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on May 8, had been at Changi Airport Terminal 3 on May 3 and May 4. He visited the same locations as two other cases during their infectious period.

"Beefing up newsrooms, improving user experience top priorities amid SPH restructuring: Khaw Boon Wan","SINGAPORE: Ensuring a smooth transition amid the restructuring, beefing up newsrooms and improving user experience for Singapore Press Holding’s (SPH) media products are among the key priorities for Mr Khaw Boon Wan, who will chair the entity overseeing SPH’s media business when it is hived off. 

Speaking at a media conference on Wednesday (May 12), the former Cabinet minister said the new media business, SPH Media Trust, must be able to attract and retain skilled talent to achieve its goals of providing quality journalism.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
“I heard that because of several years of cost pressures, some newsrooms ... may have been weakened or diminished in capacity or ability to retain good staff. We will use this opportunity to try to beef it up,” said Mr Khaw. 

“Pass the word around. If you know good writers out there who left last year or recently, and they are good team workers, bring them back … I’ll find the money to pay them, so we can enhance the newsroom and push on with what we need to do,” he said.

As for user experience, he said that access to digital products must be made more seamless and user-friendly. He also said he wants to “define customers more widely”, adding that he will be working to understand newsrooms’ workflows more intimately.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
Earlier at a townhall with SPH employees, Mr Khaw highlighted a few initiatives that will help the media company meet future challenges, enhance its digital products and grow a younger audience.

These include an SPH Media Academy that will be set up to train recruits and existing employees. SPH Media will step up the award of scholarships, which will be in digital disciplines as well as in journalism.

For current journalists, there will be fellowships and attachments in world-class newsrooms, Mr Khaw said in his speech. 

During the media conference, Mr Khaw was asked about his approach to ensuring editorial integrity, He said the ultimate goal is to make sure SPH continues to have products that people trust, which are fact-based and “understand Singapore’s interests at heart”.

“There are many factors to achieve this ... The quality of the newsroom is one, but equally, it's the independence of the newsroom.

“You undermine that – you undermine what we are trying to achieve. That is my position. To me, it is crystal clear,” he said.

NATION-BUILDING OBJECTIVES

A reporter also asked Mr Khaw about the role vernacular newspaper outlets will have in the new entity and the kind of resources they will be given.

In response, Mr Khaw said that these titles serve different audiences with varying market sizes.

But he added that “the metrics of measuring success and therefore resource allocation” to these outlets cannot just be seen in terms of dollars and cents, but also in the role they play in nation-building.

“Money will always be important. But it is not just money alone …  At the highest level, what are our strategic objectives? We want a well-informed population. We want a united people and we want a deeply engaged citizenship, who knows Singapore interests and Singaporean values” he said.

“So as SPH media, we must think it through and think about how can we help contribute to this higher objective … And from there, I think we can translate into what are suitable metrics that our newsroom can contribute,” he said.

Mr Khaw added that he was confident in SPH titles’ abilities to grow their reach overseas.

This would be key in the business’ success, given that Singapore only has a small domestic market with 1.2 million households.

Even if these were all paid subscribers, it would not be enough to make the business financially sustainable, Mr Khaw said.

He gave the example of The New York Times, which had to grow its subscriber base from one million to seven million, before it could “look at the possibility of making profits annually”.

THE NEED FOR PAYWALLS

When asked about plans to continue with subscription models for SPH titles, Mr Khaw said he has “strong views” about pricing, calling it both “a science and an art”.

“If your objective is to chase eyeballs, the easiest is to make it free,” he said.

But if the objective is to produce quality journalism, requiring paid subscriptions would help the newsroom by putting pressure on it to create content that customers find value in, Mr Khaw said.

“If you insist on paid (subscriptions), and your product is ordinary … without much analysis or insight, why should people pay?

“This paid model forces us to make sure you are a lot more analytical and more importantly, (providing) original insights which I can’t get from the competition.”

“I’M NOT A JOURNALIST”: KHAW

Mr Khaw was also asked about his concerns about taking on an industry that he has no experience in.

He retired ahead of the General Election in July last year, after helming the Health Ministry, Transport Ministry and National Development Ministry over the course of his political career.

“My big worry was what can I do to help you all? My coming here is to help SPH Media, but if I cannot make a difference, then it’s a waste of time, or a missed opportunity, as someone put it, Mr Khaw said.

I don't know how to be a journalist and I am not a journalist. I'm out of my depth here. And therefore, how can I interfere in the newsroom?”

He added, however, that he knows what value-add he brings to the table.

“My main contribution, I hope, is a significant one, which is: If I can help you reflect, reconstruct your products, to help us realise bigger potential and make the SPH Media brand even better, why not?”"
Woman dies after falling from height at Tan Tock Seng Hospital,"A 27-year-old woman has died after falling from the 6th floor at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) on Wednesday (May 12).

She had attended an outpatient clinic appointment accompanied by her family members before her death, TTSH said in a Facebook post.

Witnesses found the woman at the escalator lobby on basement 2 after her fall. 

CCTV footage shows that she had climbed over the railing and jumped off at Level 6, TTSH said.

Our medical staff attended to her immediately. She was brought to our emergency department and despite our efforts, had later succumbed to her injuries.

The hospital added: “Investigations are ongoing and we are working with the police on this matter.

The police received a call for assistance at 12.10pm on Wednesday, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) said in response to queries. 

A 27-year-old woman was reported to have been found lying unconscious at the basement 2 escalator lobby of the Tan Tock Seng Medical Centre. She was attended to by hospital doctors and subsequently pronounced dead, SPF said. 

TTSH added that a doctor and medical social worker are helping to support the woman’s family.

Earlier this month, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said TTSH would work with patients requiring specialist outpatient clinic services to defer their appointments or move them online.

Specialist outpatient clinic patients requiring in-person care would be seen by staff members who are not linked to the COVID-19 cluster at TTSH, said MOH. 

Minimising the number of outpatients visiting the hospital is one of many measures the Health Ministry has put in place in an attempt to curb the spread of the coronavirus there. 

The cluster at TTSH is currently Singapore's largest active cluster. "

Changi Airport handled an all-time high of 68 million passengers in 2019 while Mr Shum was at the helm, while Changi Airport Terminal 4 and Jewel Changi Airport also opened during his time in charge.

“Singapore Airlines carried a record 36 million passengers to 136 destinations and the airline also restored ultra-long range flights to North America and began operations of several new aircraft types,” MOT said.

Mr Shum also boosted Singapore’s profile internationally during his time at the helm of CAAS, MOT said. Under his leadership, Singapore was re-elected to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Council “with the highest-ever number of votes”.

“Singapore helped to develop ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, the world’s first global carbon offsetting scheme,” MOT said.

“He chaired international committees and helped the ICAO’s Council Aviation Recovery Task Force to guide government and industry operators to restart the international air transport sector to recover from the impact of COVID-19 on a coordinated basis.”"
"10 new community COVID-19 cases in Singapore, including Sengkang General Hospital nurse","SINGAPORE: Ten cases in the community were among 16 new COVID-19 infections reported in Singapore as of noon on Wednesday (May 12), said the Ministry of Health (MOH).

She was discharged on May 2 and continued to be on quarantine. She was tested for COVID-19 on May 11 during quarantine. Her test result came back positive on the same day. 

Her serology test result is negative for the N antigen, which suggests the presence of early infection, said MOH. 

The cluster at TTSH now has 44 cases.

FOREIGN DOMESTIC WORKER AMONG IMPORTED CASES

The remaining six COVID-19 cases reported on Wednesday were imported and were placed on stay-home notice upon their arrival in Singapore, said the ministry. 

They include a Singaporean and permanent resident who both returned from India. Three are work pass holders who arrived from Malaysia, the Philippines and Sri Lanka. The remaining case is a foreign domestic worker from the Philippines who holds a work permit. 

The arrivals from the Indian sub-continent had already come into Singapore before the restrictions on travel were imposed, said MOH.

No new infections were reported in foreign workers’ dormitories.

31 MORE PATIENTS DISCHARGED

MOH said the overall number of new cases in the community has decreased from 62 cases in the week before to 49 cases in the past week.

CHANGI AIRPORT CLUSTER GROWS

Including the seven new infections reported on Wednesday, the Changi Airport COVID-19 cluster has now grown to 25 cases, including household contacts and family members of previous cases.

The first infection in the cluster was detected on May 5, when an 88-year-old man who works as a cleaner at Terminal 3 tested positive.

A Victoria Junior College student who tested positive for the virus on May 7 has also since been linked to the Changi Airport cluster.

The student had visited the Kopitiam food court at Changi Airport Terminal 3 on May 3, the same day as two other cases in the Changi Airport cluster, said MOH in an update on the case on Tuesday.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and Changi Airport Group (CAG) said last Sunday that all workers in Changi Airport’s operating terminals will be tested for COVID-19 in a special testing operation.

About 9,000 workers from Terminal 1, Terminal 3 and Jewel Changi Airport will undergo these tests. Terminal 2 is not open.

While the special testing operation is ongoing, the passenger terminal buildings will be closed to the public from May 13 to May 27, said CAAS and CAG on Wednesday.

Only passengers with air tickets and essential airport workers will be able to access the passenger terminals during this period.

Jewel Changi Airport will also be closed for 14 days, they said.

MOH also said in its release on Wednesday that it is offering free COVID-19 testing to members of the public who had visited Changi Airport Terminal 3 from May 3.

MOH will progressively inform these individuals via SMS notification with information on how to book an appointment for their test.

SINGAPORE ON KNIFE-EDGE

In ministerial statements in Parliament on Tuesday, Education Minister Lawrence Wong and Health Minister Gan Kim Yong provided updates on the COVID-19 situation in Singapore.

Mr Wong said that Singapore is now on a knife-edge, with community case numbers that could go either way over the next few weeks.

While Singapore has a chance of “getting things under control” by the end of the month, it only takes one lapse or one irresponsible action for an infection to happen, he said.

As of May 9, about 1.8 million people in Singapore have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, with 1.2 million of them receiving their second dose, said Mr Gan in his statement.

S$320 million in contracts awarded for works on Johor Bahru-Singapore RTS Link,"Nine contracts worth about RM1 billion (S$320 million) were recently awarded for systems works on the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link, said operator RTS Operations.

RTS Operations - formed in 2020 as a joint venture between Singapore’s SMRT and Malaysian rail operator Prasarana - said on Wednesday (May 12) that these works for the cross-border rail link are “progressing well”.

Of the nine contracts, four are for core systems, with China’s CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co awarded the contract for rolling stock while German firm Siemens Mobility won the contract for signalling system and platform screen doors. 

Malaysia’s Sapura Rail Systems was awarded the contract for the communications and integrated supervisory control systems.

The remaining non-core system contracts were awarded for trackwork, traction power supply, uninterruptible power supply, automatic fare collection, as well as depot equipment and service vehicles.

A systems consultancy contract had also earlier been awarded to engineering firm CH2M Services to deliver consultancy services for the design, manufacturing, delivery, testing and commissioning of all systems for the RTS line, RTS Operations said. 

“We are pleased with the outcome of the tender exercise. There is a good mix of local and international players working together to make the RTS Link a success,” said RTSO chief executive officer Shamsul Rizal Md Yusof. 

RTSO chairman Mohd Farid Mohd Adnan said the firm’s board and management are “fully committed to deliver the RTS project despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic”.

Incorporated in Singapore, RTS Operations will own, design, build, finance and manage operating assets for the RTS Link, including trains, tracks and systems. 

RTS Operations will also be responsible for operating and maintaining the rail line, including the Wadi Hana depot in Johor Bahru.

Scheduled to be completed by 2026, the 4km-long RTS Link will connect Bukit Chagar in Johor Bahru with Woodlands North in Singapore. 

It is expected to be able to transport up to 10,000 passengers per hour in each direction, with the journey taking about five minutes excluding custom clearance. 

In November last year, Malaysia began construction work on the rail link,  which will replace the existing KTM shuttle train service.

In January, work began on the S$932.8 million Woodlands North station of the RTS Link, which includes tunnels and a linked Customs, Immigration and Quarantine building.

A S$180 million contract for the construction of a 25m-tall viaduct across the Strait of Johor as well as tunnels was also awarded in January. 

The RTS Link is expected to cost around RM10 billion (S$3.25 billion), with Singapore bearing 61 per cent of the cost."
Media veteran Patrick Daniel to be interim CEO for SPH Media Trust,"SINGAPORE: Veteran journalist Patrick Daniel will be the interim CEO for SPH Media Trust, the new entity that will be formed after Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) restructures its media business. 

Mr Daniel was former deputy CEO of SPH and previously editor-in-chief of the company’s English/Malay/Tamil Media Group.

Announcing the appointment on Wednesday afternoon (May 12), Mr Khaw Boon Wan, who will chair the non-profit entity that is to oversee SPH Media Trust, said he expects the transition to be “uneventful”.

“My immediate priority is to ensure a smooth transition, without any disruption to the current media business,” said Mr Khaw at a townhall with SPH employees.

“Practically all 2,500 media and media-related staff of SPH will move over to SPH Media Trust.”

Reporters were invited to cover Mr Khaw's opening speech to the employees. The townhall was then closed to the media.

SPH had announced last week that it will hive off its core media business amid falling advertising revenue. 

All the media business units in the company will be transferred to a newly formed public company limited by guarantee (CLG), which will be run as a not-for-profit entity. 

SPH will provide the initial resources and funding to capitalise SPH Media with a cash injection of S$80 million, S$30 million worth of SPH shares and SPH REIT units, as well as SPH's stakes in four of its digital media investments.

It was announced in Parliament on Monday that Mr Khaw, a former Cabinet minister, will be chairman of the CLG.

MANAGEMENT SHAREHOLDERS TO JOIN CLG

In his speech to SPH employees on Wednesday, Mr Khaw reiterated that the media business is unsustainable amid the severe disruption caused by digital media.

It will be a struggle to sustain quality journalism as a public good, he said.

Delisting SPH's media business and transferring it to a CLG will allow it to retain the financial discipline of a commercial enterprise while also having the option of seeking funding from the Government and other sources for digital transformation, said Mr Khaw.

The Government is willing to help SPH Media build capacity, pilot innovations and scale up to increase impact and outreach.

Public funding will have to be accounted for and will be directed at capacity building, said Mr Khaw. Such funding is already available to other media companies, including Mediacorp.

The nine management shareholders of SPH have been sounded out to form SPH Media Trust, said Mr Khaw,

They are OCBC, Great Eastern, UOB, DBS, Singtel, NTUC Income, Temasek via Fullerton, the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University.

They have agreed to be the founding members of the CLG, to continue their mission of supporting quality journalism, said Mr Khaw in his speech.

He added that more trustees will join in due course and the planned cut-over date is Sep 1, at the earliest.

DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION

Mr Daniel retired on Sep 1, 2017, after three decades in the media industry. He held various positions at the company, including editor of the Business Times and editor-in-chief of the English/Malay/Tamil Media Group, before retiring as deputy chief executive of SPH.

SPH said in 2017 that Mr Daniel was to continue as a part-time consultant and help CEO Ng Yat Chung in managing some SPH subsidiaries and projects.

Before joining the media, Mr Daniel was in the Singapore Government’s Administrative Service, where his last position was a director in the Ministry of Trade and Industry.

I am grateful to Patrick for agreeing to help us out. Like me, he is enjoying his retirement. But he has a strong personal interest to see SPH Media succeed, said Mr Khaw in his speech, adding that he will begin a search for a CEO who can take SPH Media into the future as a multilingual digital media organisation.

At a media conference later, Mr Khaw said the search for a longer-term CEO for the CLG will ideally be completed by next year, but noted that the right talent is not easy to find.

“In terms of the kind of people we are looking for … I think it will be very hard to get a foreigner, to be able to instinctively understand what this Singaporean interest is all about, said Khaw in response to a question from CNA.

“And ideally, therefore, I hope we can find one Singaporean who may not be here today, but maybe somewhere overseas. And hopefully - digitally savvy. Even better, if (the person comes) with actual digital media experience.

When asked how long he will remain interim CEO, Mr Daniel said: I'll stay for as long as I'm needed.

Mr Khaw said he has started to meet SPH employees in small groups to listen to their concerns and aspirations, and will continue to do so over the next few weeks. 

He highlighted a few initiatives after the transition that will help the media company meet future challenges, to enhance its digital products, grow a younger audience and boost its digital revenue.

An SPH Media Academy will be set up to train recruits and existing employees, build a first-class digital tech team and from next year, SPH Media will step up the award of SPH scholarships, which will be in digital disciplines as well as in journalism.

For current journalists, there will be fellowships and attachments in world-class newsrooms, he added.

This is the start of a new chapter for SPH Media. The last time we had a major restructuring was in the early 1980s, said Mr Khaw. Now, the strategic objective remains the same - to preserve quality newspapers in all four languages trusted by readers, and to sustain them over the long term.

The transfer of SPH's media assets to the CLG is subject to SPH shareholders' approval at an extraordinary general meeting to be convened at a later date."
Singapore Red Cross raises more than S$3.2 million in donations to help India fight COVID-19,"The Singapore Red Cross has received more than S$3.2 million in donations from organisations and individuals since the launch of its India COVID-19 public appeal two weeks ago, it said on Wednesday (May 12). 

The first tranche of aid, worth about S$3.6 million, includes oxygen concentrators, oxygen cylinders as well as ventilators to directly support patients and healthcare workers in hospitals in India, said the organisation.

There are also hygiene and medical kits for those in quarantine centres, under home quarantine, as well as frontline workers and volunteers responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

On Apr 28, the Singapore Red Cross said in a press release that it launched a public appeal to deliver assistance and support communities in India that are affected, or at risk of being affected, by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The funds will be used to purchase urgently needed medical equipment and supplies, such as ventilators, oxygen cylinders and oxygen concentrators, it said. 

As of Wednesday, 1,300 oxygen cylinders, three ISO cryogenic tanks and five ventilators have arrived in India and are being distributed to public hospitals and other healthcare support institutions.

Further shipments of more than four million surgical masks, 1.5 million N95 masks, 2,000 oxygen concentrators, 1,200 oxygen cylinders and 150 ventilators are expected to arrive over the next coming weeks. 

The items being sent by the Singapore Red Cross will be distributed throughout India through the India Red Cross Society, it said. 

The organisation added that it is working with the India Red Cross Society to distribute the ventilators and oxygen concentrators to seven states in India most affected by the pandemic: Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Telangana.

As more funds are raised, it will be committed to additional purchases and deployment in the most needed areas of India, said the Singapore Red Cross. 

Secretary-General of the Singapore Red Cross Benjamin William said the surge in global demand has resulted in shortage of medical supplies for immediate delivery. 

Over the past weeks, we have been meeting key stakeholders on a daily basis to coordinate our response to the pressing needs in India. 

We are leveraging our regional networks and partnerships to secure the supplies and to get them where they are most needed, he said. 

Mr William said the Singapore Red Cross is grateful for the outpouring of support from individuals and organisations. 

With the number of cases in India increasing day by day, the needs on the ground are growing in tandem, and so are the resources required to support affected and at-risk communities. 

Our current focus is on maximising the impact of these donations, to help strengthen communities to eventually overcome the outbreak, he said.

Brother linked to sister's death: Two more charged with grievously hurting teenager,"Two more people have been charged with causing grievous hurt to a 19-year-old girl who died, a week after the victim’s brother was linked to her death.

Chee Mei Wan, a 41-year-old Singapore permanent resident, and 62-year-old Lim Peng Tiong were charged on Wednesday (May 12) with voluntarily causing grievous hurt to Ms Huang Baoying by hitting her with a wooden pole.

Court documents did not specify the relationship between Chee, Lim and Ms Huang.

Ms Huang’s brother, 29-year-old Huang Bocan, had his charge amended. He is now accused of sharing a common intention with Chee and Lim to cause grievous hurt to his sister by hitting her with the pole.

The incident is said to have occurred at about 11pm on May 4 at Block 602 Clementi West Street 1.

Police previously said they were alerted to the unnatural death at 6.30am the next day and arrived to find Ms Huang dead.

If convicted, the trio could be jailed for up to 10 years and fined or caned."
Putting dreams on hold: Young Singaporean relocates to JB to care for grandparents as COVID-19 shuts border,"JOHOR BAHRU: For Iman Nurhannah Mohamed Fariq and her grandparents, who are living in a rented condominium unit in Johor Bahru, this year’s Hari Raya Puasa will not feel right.

There will be no family members sitting around the veranda sharing ketupat and lodeh. No hugging and seeking forgiveness from one another. No posing for family photos in matching attire.

Amer Amat and Rahmah Zainolabidin are Singapore citizens who have been living in Johor Bahru for most of their lives. When the movement control order (MCO) was first declared in March 2020, they decided to stay on as they could not move all their belongings in time.

Moreover, Amer, who had just suffered a stroke, was in no condition to travel. 

Iman Nurhannah, 22, was in the first year of a business and management course at the Institute of Technical Education in Singapore. She dropped everything and went over to Johor to care for her grandparents.

“I moved over because I was worried how grandma and grandfather will cope. My mother and siblings all had other obligations, and I felt that it was easiest for me to go,” said Iman Nurhannah when interviewed by CNA.

“I was putting my career and dreams on hold. But I felt (caring for my grandparents) was important too,” she added.

Before the pandemic, she would only visit during the weekends, when she had no classes. Now, she is the pillar of the household.

“I’m thankful for what she has done,” said Rahmah. I know that deep down she wants to go home, but her mother won’t allow it because she wants her to take care of us,” said Rahmah.

CHALLENGES IN HEALTHCARE, EXPENSES AS BORDER STAYS SHUT 

The past 14 months has been a trying time for the trio. 

“We try not to go out if we can help it. Unless it's for groceries or medicine for grandpa, we don’t leave the house ... We are here hanging on, hoping to stay safe and healthy,” said Iman Nurhannah.

Rahmah recalled the day when her husband was hit by a sudden stroke when he was sleeping at his home in Skudai. “He was taking a nap on his bed and he suddenly fell off the side. He called for me but when I came, he was no longer able to raise his hand or move his limbs. This was later diagnosed as a mild stroke by the general practitioner doctor we visited.”

Amer has treatment once a week. “A physiotherapist would come and work with him. But if we don’t have enough money, we will ask the physio to come once a month instead,” said Iman Nurhannah.

Rahmah explained that as all three of them were not working, they are dependent on her daughter (Iman Nurhannah’s mother) and a younger son to support them. Both are working in Singapore.

“They give us some money to pay our rent and utilities, but we don’t want to overburden them too much,” said Rahmah.

Ideally, the family would like to return to Singapore. “Once we are in Singapore, we can seek treatment and financial help from the government agencies because we are citizens,” Iman Nurulhannah noted.

While there are legal provisions for them to return to Singapore via the land checkpoints, they are unable to afford the ambulance costs needed to transport Amer across the Causeway as well as quarantine costs for all three of them.

Iman Nurulhannah said: “For us to head back, it will cost around S$2,000 to charter a private ambulance for us to go across the Causeway. Then there are also quarantine costs.

Now with the 21-day quarantine imposed for those coming from Malaysia, it could cost us up to S$3,000 per person. That’s more than S$10,000 for just one trip, we simply cannot afford it.”

Given the costs involved, they have decided to stay put for now. But the situation is complicated by their immigration status.

Last month, Malaysia said those who were holding expired social visit passes and stranded due to the MCO were required to leave the country by Apr 21 or risk being penalised. 

However, Malaysia's Immigration Department director-general Khairul Dzaimee Daud said foreigners who were unable to leave the country by Apr 21 may apply for a special pass to extend their stay.

The three of them have appealed to extend their social visit passes with Malaysia’s Immigration Department but they have been unsuccessful so far.

“We appealed on the basis of a doctor’s letter saying that my grandfather is not fit to travel, in the hope that the immigration authorities can show some compassion and grant us an extension,” said Iman Nurulhannah.

“A SAD AND QUIET HARI RAYA”

Rahmah said for the festival later this week, the trio would just “sit at home quietly”.

“Every (Hari) Raya, it’s a tradition for all of us, my siblings and my mother, to come here for our last breaking fast during Ramadan. Then we would welcome Hari Raya together, cook festive food and just celebrate the occasion. But this year, it will be a sad and quiet Hari Raya because it’s just us three.”

She added: “We won’t even cook the usual Hari Raya dishes because it’ll be wasting food. What’s worse, Amer’s condition is such that he can’t even walk and eat solid food, so we are in no mood to be festive.”

Despite the subdued mood, both granddaughter and grandmother said they are blessed.

“Hari Raya is about family. The situation this year is far from ideal, but it serves as a reminder to be grateful that the three of us are here together, supporting one another,” said Rahmah.

Looking ahead, Iman Nurulhannah said that she would prefer to return to Singapore to resume her studies and work to help her family financially.

“My plan is to go back to Singapore, work full time and when I have enough, around S$8,000, enrol into a diploma course on food and beverage supervision at the Singapore Hotel and Tourism Education Centre (SHATEC),” she said.

“I’m praying that the border reopens so my mother and I can straddle between working and taking care of grandma and grandpa,” she added."
Great Singapore Sale teams up with Lazada; says move is 'timely' amid return to Phase 2 restrictions,"The Great Singapore Sale (GSS) will team up with online shopping platform Lazada this year – a move that its organisers said is “timely” amid the country’s return to stricter COVID-19 measures and a transformed retail scene.

The annual shopping affair, which started 27 years ago, will run from Jun 6 to Jul 7, said the Singapore Retailers Association (SRA) on Wednesday (May 12). 

AdvertisementAdvertisement
The campaign went online for the first time last year amid the pandemic, with livestreaming activities and virtual workshops held over four weeks on SRA’s online platform.

With the pandemic far from over and the recent rise in Singapore's community infections prompting a return to Phase 2 restrictions until end-May, the SRA said it hopes to tap on Lazada’s expertise in helping retailers to move online. 

“The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on consumer shopping habits and accelerated retailers’ urgency to expand their digital presence quickly so as to stay engaged with their consumers and develop alternative sales channels,” said SRA’s president R Dhinakaran in a press release.

“Our partnership with Lazada this GSS is timely, in light of tighter SMM (safe management measures) guidelines limiting shopper traffic to stores and malls, and a changed retail landscape,” he added.

The recent tightening of safety measures will be in place until May 30, a week before the start of the GSS. 

Asked if the SRA is preparing for the possibility that stricter rules could last longer, Mr Dhinakaran said it would be difficult for him to predict the duration of these rules but SRA hopes to continue having an online aspect for the annual sale given changes in the industry.

“Every retailer will understand that the seamless integration of their physical stores with the online (world) is critical for today’s success,” he told reporters at a hybrid press conference. “We think Lazada is one of the right partners to grow this online-offline relationship to a much higher level.”

Mr Dhinakaran added: “(The GSS) is one of the signature events every year … and we want to try various ways and means to improve … in order to make it much more successful and growing.”

The GSS this year will be a four-week affair with weekly thematic sales across different product categories, such as technology, groceries, home, baby, fashion, as well as health and beauty. It will kick off with Lazada’s monthly sale campaign on Jun 6 before ending with the platform’s other sale event on Jul 7.

Apart from promotions, there will be “shoppertainment” livestreams and games, said Lazada Singapore’s chief executive James Chang.

More than 80,000 brands on Lazada’s platform are expected to participate in this year’s GSS, in addition to the 100 member brands from SRA.

A key feature of the sale this year is to allow shoppers to make purchases at a retail brand’s online store on Lazada and pick them up at the brand’s physical outlet.

This feature gives customers an additional delivery option and offers retailers a hybrid operating model while helping them build up their online presence, said the organisers.

Retailers can benefit from Lazada’s technology infrastructure, payments gateway and delivery solutions with third-party logistics partners. This eliminates many costly barriers that retailers face when selling online, the organisers added.

Each retailer will also have a dedicated account manager to navigate features such as flash sales and Lazada's livestreaming service LazLive. 

To incentivise retailers, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), those new to its LazMall marketplace for brands and authorised distributors will not have to pay commission for the first three months.

SRA’s Mr Dhinakaran said through the pandemic, many retailers have “come to view e-commerce platforms not as competitors, but an imperative for business growth and consumer acquisition”.

But even with government grants, a minority group of SMEs who never had experience in online retail still face difficulties such as logistics and putting in place new systems.

Lazada will be able to “hand-hold” these SMEs, said Mr Dhinakaran.

“They can tailor-make according to the size of the companies, and what kind of products they are doing. They are professionals in the (online) field and will guide what is suitable for the retailer,” he added.

Lazada's Mr Chang said the platform hopes to do its part to rally the retail industry during a challenging period and equip the industry with the necessary tools.

“By supporting sellers with the tools they need to move their businesses online, we’re helping them be prepared for the future – both during the pandemic and beyond,” he said."
"More than 500,000 young Singaporeans to receive S$200 Edusave or PSEA top-up","About 532,500 Singaporeans aged between seven and 20 in 2021 will each receive a one-off top-up of S$200 to their Edusave account or Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA) this month.

The top-ups are a component of this year's Budget, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and Ministry of Education (MOE) said in a joint statement on Wednesday (May 12)
AdvertisementAdvertisement
“This additional top-up is part of the Household Support Package announced at Budget 2021 to provide families with additional support for their children’s education-related expenses,” the ministries said.

“The top-up to the Edusave account is in addition to the annual Edusave contribution that the Government makes.”

Edusave and PSEA funds can be used to pay for approved fees and enrichment programmes.

The top-ups will be credited directly into Edusave accounts and PSEAs by the end of this month with no action required from recipients. Eligible recipients will receive letters informing them of successful top-ups next month.

According to MOF’s website, Singaporean children aged six and under in 2021 will also receive a S$200 top-up to their Child Development Accounts (CDA) in September.

In total, about 780,000 young Singaporeans are expected to benefit from top-ups as part of the Household Support Package, MOF said.

More information on the Household Support Package is available on the MOF website. "
Man fined and sentenced to corrective work for throwing cigarette butt; caught littering 8 times in 12 years,"A repeat offender was fined S$3,600 and sentenced to perform 12 hours of corrective work for throwing a cigarette butt in a public place, said the National Environment Agency (NEA) on Wednesday (May 12). 

Peh Choe Kong, 49,  was convicted in court on May 7. This is his eighth conviction for littering, said the agency. 
AdvertisementAdvertisement
On Jul 9, 2020, NEA enforcement officers witnessed Peh throwing a cigarette butt on the ground outside of Tampines 1 mall. 

During the trial, Peh said he had thrown the cigarette butt into a makeshift container placed on the ground and not onto the ground as witnessed by enforcement officers, said NEA. 

At the end of the trial, the Court accepted the prosecution’s case and convicted the accused, it said. 

In arriving at the sentence, the Court took into consideration that Peh had seven previous convictions for littering offences from 2008 to 2018, NEA added. 
AdvertisementAdvertisement
If Peh fails to pay the court fine, he will have to serve 10 days of jail in default. 

Singapore has a strict anti-littering enforcement regime, said the agency, adding that it has issued about 19,000 tickets for littering offences in 2020. 

Under the Environmental Public Health Act, anyone who commits a littering offence is liable to a fine of up to S$2,000 for a first conviction, S$4,000 for a second conviction and S$10,000 for third and subsequent convictions. 

The court may also impose a Corrective Work Order, requiring offenders to clean public areas for up to 12 hours. "
6 building owners charged under Fire Safety Act for occupying premises without valid fire certificate,"Six building owners were charged in court under the Fire Safety Act for occupying premises without a valid fire certificate, said the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) on Wednesday (May 12). 

The building owners had allowed their premises to be occupied without a valid fire certificate, ranging between one to two months, said the authorities in a news release. 
AdvertisementAdvertisement
SCDF said it had alerted the six owners to renew their fire certificates two months prior to their expiry. Multiple reminders were also issued thereafter. 

However, the owners had disregarded the reminders and failed to renew the certificates. They also allowed the premises to be occupied even after the certificates had expired. 

The list of premises are: 

121 Neythal Road, Singapore 628606

27 Foch Road, Singapore 209264

40 Tuas West Road, Singapore 638389

175 Bencoolen Street, Singapore 189649

5 Tuas View Lane, Singapore 637291

3 Pioneer Sector Walk, Singapore 627897

AdvertisementAdvertisement
The owners were fined between S$1,400 and S$2,000, said SCDF. All the premises have since renewed their fire certificate. 

Under the Fire Safety Act, premises must have a valid fire certificate before they can be occupied. The certificate shows that the fire safety measures installed within the premises have been checked to be in working condition and that the building is safe to be occupied. 

Fire safety measures include automatic sprinkler systems, fire alarm systems and emergency power supply. 

Advertisement
The fire certificate has to be renewed every one to three years, depending on the premises' fire risk and extent of fire safety measures required. 

A professional engineer must be engaged to check the serviceability of its measures before SCDF approves the fire certificate renewal, it said. 

SCDF said it takes a very serious view of fire certificate related offences, especially occupied premises without a valid certificate. 

A valid fire certificate is issued only after a building's fire safety measures have been checked to be in working condition. 

If these critical systems are not functioning, there is great risk to the building’s occupants during emergencies, and can lead to severe consequences such as loss of life and damage to property. 

We urge all building owners to play their part to ensure the safety of the occupants of their premises, said SCDF. "
Construction on 2 Jurong Region Line MRT stations to start this month,"Construction works on two MRT stations on the Jurong Region Line (JRL) will start later this month, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said on Wednesday (May 12).

The two stations, currently known as JS9 and JS10, will be located along Jalan Boon Lay near Enterprise Road and Jalan Tukang respectively.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
The two stations are expected to be completed by 2029.

The civil contract for the construction of the two stations, valued at S$241 million, was awarded to China Harbour (Singapore) Engineering Company.

Formerly known as Zhen Hua Singapore Engineering, the company has been operating in Singapore for more than 35 years, said LTA. The company is currently involved in building the Thomson-East Coast Line's Siglap station. The company has also worked on rail projects in Macau and Thailand.

The contract also includes a 1.5km viaduct between the stations, over Jurong Central Park and Jalan Boon Lay, LTA said in a news release.

The JRL is Singapore’s seventh MRT line. It will serve five key locations in the west: Choa Chu Kang, Jurong East, Boon Lay/Jurong West, Jurong Industrial Estate and NTU.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
The line will have 24 stations above ground, and will connect with the North-South Line and East-West Line with interchange stations at Boon Lay, Choa Chu Kang and Jurong East MRT stations.

The 24km-long line was originally scheduled to start operations in 2026, but this timeline may be delayed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, LTA said on its website.

In light of COVID-19-induced factors such as a general manpower crunch due to border closures and materials supply disruptions, the completion timelines for a number of LTA projects have been delayed up to a year,” it said.

“The revised rail completion and opening timelines are being finalised and updates will be issued in due course.

“LTA has awarded a contract for the supply of 62 fully automated and driverless car trains for the JRL. The first train is expected to arrive in Singapore around mid-2024.”

With the JRL’s completion, 60,000 more households will be within a 10-minute walk from a train station. As key residential areas such as Tengah new town develop over time, more households will benefit from the line in future, LTA said.

Commuters in the area will see time savings once the line is completed. For example, it will take 25 minutes to travel from Choa Chu Kang Avenue 4 to the Jurong industrial area, down from the 50 minutes it currently takes, LTA said."
Man died rescuing dogs after PMD left charging caught fire; coroner rules death unfortunate misadventure,"A man who tried to rescue his dogs from a fire that broke out in his flat suffered burns on 40 per cent of his body and later died. A personal mobility device that had been left to charge had caught fire, which spread to the rest of the flat.

The coroner ruled 40-year-old Goh Keng Soon's death an unfortunate misadventure in findings made available this week.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
Mr Goh and his wife lived in a flat in Bukit Batok Street 21. His wife told the court that Mr Goh had picked her up from work on Jul 17, 2019.

After telling her that the power to his Speedway-brand PMD had cut off, he began charging it in the living room next to his wife's two PMDs.

The couple watched television, then closed the living room windows and went to bed just before midnight.

At about 12.30am on Jul 18, 2019, Mr Goh's wife heard noises and woke her husband up thinking that there was someone in the living room.

However, when they opened the bedroom door, black smoke entered the room, she testified. She tried calling 995 twice, but the reception was bad.

She managed to confirm her address with the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) at 12.47am and they told her they were on their way.

The couple retreated into a walk-in closet connected to their master bedroom and opened the windows to get some air, but there was still a lot of smoke.

They used plush toys to cover their noses and headed towards the master bedroom toilet, but heard their two dogs barking from the living room.

Mr Goh told his wife to go to the toilet and wait, before leaving to rescue their dogs. Shortly after, she heard her husband scream and tried to open the toilet door, but the handle was too hot to the touch.

When the ceiling fixtures began to melt and fall on her, she climbed out of the toilet window and onto the air-conditioner ledge.

Meanwhile, the couple's neighbours gathered outside and tried to extinguish the fire using an internal hose reel from the lobby outside their flat.

SCDF ARRIVED TO FIND MR GOH PASSED OUT

Firefighters and police officers arrived at the flat on the 26th floor and forcibly entered the unit. They found Mr Goh collapsed on the floor in the common toilet, while his wife was on the aircon ledge outside. The two dogs were rescued.

Mr Goh and his wife were both taken to hospital. Mr Goh was assessed to be in cardiac arrest, with second-degree partial-thickness burns on about 40 per cent of his body. He died two days later on Jul 20, 2019.

His cause of death was certified as multi-organ failure following a heart attack with thermal burns and coronary artery disease.

A fire investigation report by the SCDF showed that the fire had originated in the living room where the PMDs were placed. As the circuit breaker had tripped, there was likely to be an electrical anomaly that was caused either by the charging of the PMD, or the effects of the fire from the living room.

Remnants of spent battery cells believed to be lithium-ion cells from the PMDs were recovered from the area where the fire originated.

The charging circuit was traced to the Speedway PMD, which had a two-pin plug inserted into a four-socket extension cord via a two-pin adapter. The extension cord was connected to the wall socket.

OVERHEATING, LOOSENED CONTACTS FOUND

Localised resistance overheating with arching and melting was found at the two-pin plug and the charging port in the PMD, due to loosened contacts and a faulty charger.

Overheating was also found in the battery packs of the Speedway PMD, due to an ineffective battery management system. The damage to the other two PMDs was secondary in nature, caused by the radiant heat flux from the fire outbreak which resulted in a thermal runaway in the two other PMDs, causing further heat damage in the living room.

A technical report concluded that the fire was primarily caused by the overheating at the two-pin plug and charging port while the Speedway PMD was being charged.

An expert noted that the two-pin plug used in this case had flat pins and not cylindrical pins. He said the connection would not be good if a flat two-pin plug is connected to a socket that is not adapted for such a plug, as there may be a loose connection that could lead to overheating.

He gave the following recommendations: Charge PMDs or their batteries in a fully ventilated flat space and away from combustible materials; Do not leave charging devices unattended for an extended period of time or overnight; Maintain the PMDs in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendation and promptly replace any faulty adapters or chargers; Regularly examine batteries for damage or deformities such as burns, punctures, bulging, cracks, corrosion or powdery residue; and buy and use only PMDs with the UL2272 certification mark; Do not modify PMDs.

Police investigations found that the couple had bought the Speedway PMD in 2016 and did not modify the battery pack. They had used the same battery pack since it was first purchased and did not buy an additional charger for it.

PMD BOUGHT BEFORE STRICTER SAFETY REGULATIONS IMPOSED

According to the coroner's report, the PMD was designed in Korea and manufactured in China, and there were no compliance requirements or regulations set by the Land Transport Authority when it was marketed in Singapore.

A manager of LTA's active mobility group said that only UL2272 certified devices were allowed on cycling paths from Jul 1, 2020, a year after sale of non-UL2772 devices was banned.

Between 2017 and 2018, SCDF attended to 101 fires caused by non-UL2272 certified PMDs like the Speedway.

The UL2272 standard was announced in September 2018 and is a fire safety standard for motorised PMDs. However, even if a PMD has the certification, it does not mean it will not overheat or catch fire, and users should still adopt proper and safe handling of PMDs - such as not modifying their devices, not overcharging batteries and not leaving their devices unattended when charging.

The LTA manager added that users should avoid exposing their PMDs to water. If the device is exposed to wet weather conditions, it should be wiped dry immediately after use.

The coroner said there is no basis to suspect foul play, but said this tragic incident demonstrates the grave dangers of using the non-UL2272 certified PMDs.

She advised owners of such devices to dispose of them, as they pose a significant fire risk, and conveyed her condolences to Mr Goh's family for their very sad loss."
HDB officer among 2 charged under Official Secrets Act for leaking information on flat inspections,"A Housing and Development Board (HDB) officer was among two men charged on Wednesday (May 12) over unauthorised communication about flat inspections.

Kalayarasan Karuppaya was a higher estate executive with HDB during the time of the offences, said the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) in a press release.

The 54-year-old Singaporean allegedly leaked information on HDB’s impending inspections of a flat at Kim Tian Road to Damandeep Singh, a registered tenant of the unit.

Kalayarasan was not authorised to communicate the information to Damandeep, said CPIB. He did so on three occasions in May, August and September 2019.

Damandeep, a 22-year-old Indian national, allegedly received the information while having reasonable grounds to believe that it was communicated to him in contravention of the Official Secrets Act, said CPIB.

Each man faces three charges for offences under the Official Secrets Act. If convicted, they could be jailed for up to two years and fined up to S$2,000 for each charge.

“Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption and other criminal activities,” said the CPIB.

Kalayarasan has been suspended from his duties pending the outcome of the court case, said HDB in response to queries from CNA.

We will assess the situation and take appropriate disciplinary action based on the outcome of the court proceedings, said the board, adding that it takes a serious view of any unauthorised disclosure of information."
Man charged with stabbing his father with a 'sharp instrument' after dispute,"SINGAPORE: A man was charged on Wednesday (May 12) with attacking his father with a sharp instrument and leaving stab wounds on him.

Prasanth Saravanan, 21, was given one charge of voluntarily causing hurt to his father by means of a sharp instrument.

The alleged incident occurred at 11.23pm on May 10 at a pavement between Blocks 26 and 27 in Ghim Moh Link.

The court heard that Prasanth has pending charges for fraud, and had been arrested for failing to attend court under a section of the penal code for breach of home leave under the prison's mandatory aftercare scheme.

No bail was offered to him.

According to an earlier police statement, they were alerted to a case where a 41-year-old man was attacked by his son and suffered multiple injuries.

The victim was taken conscious to hospital but his son left the scene before the police arrived. Preliminary investigations suggest that both men had a dispute before the incident.

The accused was identified and arrested within four hours of the reported incident.

If convicted of voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous means, he could be jailed up to seven years, fined, caned, or given any combination of these penalties."

NEW YORK/LONDON -U.S. shares rebounded on Thursday after falling for three consecutive days and benchmark Treasury yields edged lower as investors snapped up technology stocks and shrugged off worries over rising prices, for now.

By early morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.5per cent, the S&P 500 was up 1.4per cent, and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.3per cent.

Yields on 10-year Treasuries, which had climbed 7 basis points overnight in the biggest daily rise in two months, edged lower in early trade to stand at 1.6744per cent.

We’re certainly oversold here, so remember our 5-percent maxim: buy every S&P 500 down 5 percent close after the first one, said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.

Against a basket of major peers, the dollar was steady at 90.695, holding gains eked out on Wednesday when the greenback strengthened on data that showed U.S. faster-than-expected acceleration of inflation in April.

Before Thursday's recovery in U.S. stocks, world stock markets were spiraling toward their worst week of the year as the rise in U.S. inflation worried bond markets and as red-hot metals, crop and cryptocurrency prices all suffered sudden stops.

Asia took a pounding overnight, London's FTSE was down 2per cent before lunch, bond, commodity and U.S. futures markets were all deep in the red and Elon Musk and Tesla were no longer accepting bitcoin.

While there were plenty of idiosyncrasies, the overarching worry was that rising inflation pressure in the United States might force the Federal Reserve to start turning off its cheap money that has been driving markets rapidly higher.

Inflation pressures are going to be rising, and they're not going to be temporary, said Jeremy Gatto, investment manager at Unigestion. What does that mean? Effectively that (interest) rates will be rising.

Oil prices fell on Thursday despite a sharp drop in U.S. crude inventories, as market participants took profits following days of buying spurred by a cold snap in the largest U.S. energy-producing state.

Brent crude fell 2.4per cent 2020, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude dropped 2.6per cent.

For the cryptonites, there was a ray of light as bitcoin steadied at US$50,407 after a 13per cent drop when Elon Musk said Tesla would stop accepting it as payment because of the amount of fossil fuels that go into bitcoin mining.

Bitcoin is created by high-powered computers competing against other machines to solve complex mathematical puzzles. At current rates the process is estimated to devour about the same amount of energy annually as the Netherlands did in 2019.

Ether, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, gained 1per cent to US$3,852.43.

Businesses navigate second Ramadan amid tighter COVID-19 measures,"The streets of Geylang are lighted up but Hari Raya festivities this year will remain a muted affair.

Physical bazaars have gone online. And people are adhering to tighter COVID-19 regulations amid a rise in community cases.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
It is another blow for businesses like Fotohi Carpet Gallery, which typically enjoys higher sales during the Ramadan period.

For more than 20 years, Fotohi Carpet Gallery has joined the yearly bazaar near Tanjong Katong Complex, selling and auctioning carpets at marked-down prices.

The strategy - to sell at lower margins for a bigger volume - has paid off in the past.

Owner Reza Fotohi estimates that in 2019, the gallery netted about S$40,000 to S$50,000 during the fasting month.

The company now struggles to clear its stock of Persian carpets.

While Fotohi Carpet Gallery's showroom has resumed operations after being shut during Ramadan last year, business remains slow – barely 30 per cent of what it used to be.

The company has tried livestreaming to sell its carpets, but that has not helped much.

“Carpets still need to be sold in the traditional way. The customer needs to come down, feel the carpet, see the carpet, touch the carpet. Then we negotiate over the price, over the size, over the colours,” said Mr Fotohi.

For other businesses though, going big online has been a lifeline.

All Things Delicious café in Arab Street has seen the benefits of setting up a same-day delivery website.

Even though walk-in customers dropped by about 80 per cent during Ramadan last year - which was during the circuit breaker period - the business could keep going with online sales.

The drop in tourist visitors and cancellations of corporate catering took a toll on business revenue.

Safety protocols in staff deployment and finding reliable third-party delivery partners also posed challenges for the business.

But café founder Dewi Imelda Wadhwa said things are looking up this year, as staffing and logistics have been streamlined.

The café has launched Ramadan gift boxes and care packs.

Ms Dewi said she has also noticed that more companies are organising Ramadan celebrations.

Lessons from last year’s Ramadan are also at play for fashion ecommerce platform Zalora.

Sales for Zalora’s modest wear category started picking up as early as February.

“Usually we see the numbers spike during lunchtime or after work hours. But this year, a lot more people are home-based, so we see the numbers are quite spread out, said Ms Shasha Ahmad, modest wear category lead at Zalora Group.

We also have our suhoor campaigns that happen between 5am and 9am. We offer discount codes then. So during that time we see a spike in numbers of sales,” she said.

There are other trends too.

Online advertising firm Criteo said Ramadan purchases this year are mostly taking place via mobile phones and apps.

Criteo also said there has been a change in what consumers want during this Ramadan season.

During past Ramadan seasons, the top product categories were usually health and beauty, electronics, toys, games and home products. In 2021, the growth has been primarily in two categories – fashion/luxury, and mass merchant products.

It is a sign, market watchers say, that consumers are more focused on their immediate needs, especially given the economic downturn.

To attract consumers, businesses need to combine online and offline strategies, said Criteo.

“Brands are encouraged to focus less on promoting the price and more on the observance, said Mr Taranjeet Singh, managing director, Southeast Asia and India, Criteo.

Secondly, marketers need to be targeting the right audience, those who are most likely to shop during this period.

Third, offer consumers what they need through personalised ad campaigns. This is super important in today's hyper-connected world. Especially when consumer behaviour has become more about a one-on-one experience than one-to-many.”

"Commentary: Food delivery apps are meant to make our lives easier, not worse","Growing up, my family did not have the habit of ordering in. It was not until my secondary school years in the 1990s that a catchy Pizza Hut jingle alerted me to the existence of food delivery. 

Fast forward to the early 2000s, university mates introduced new mainstays of any social gathering or late-night mugging session: Pizza and fast food you could order through a tele-operator - you just needed to have the flyers handy. 
AdvertisementAdvertisement
However, if you wanted hawker fare or international cuisines sent to your residence, you still had to manually search for F&B outlets that had their own delivery arm. Unfortunately, there weren’t many. 

The state of the food delivery landscape remained as such until the 2010s when the gig economy started to take off and brought us operators such as foodpanda, Deliveroo, GrabFood and UberEats. 

However, using these apps in their early years was not as smooth an experience as it is today. For starters, you needed reservoirs of patience to put up with technical glitches. 
AdvertisementAdvertisement
You had to be content with the limited choice of vendors, and you might have to accept less than stellar customer service in relation to considerably steep service fees. Back then, food delivery culture was still more novelty than normality.

COVID-19 CHANGED THINGS

Since the circuit breaker in April 2020, the appetite for food delivery services has burgeoned. Major players have been incentivised to up their game to keep up with growing competition. 

For instance, according to a survey conducted by the National University of Singapore, there was a 73 per cent increase in delivered meals during the circuit breaker alone. 
Advertisement
Food vendors too are increasingly joining these platforms to gain access to a customer base that has largely gone digital. 

These developments are a win-win for consumers like me who are now reaping the benefits of vastly improved app technology, and the greater diversity of food choices and price points. 

Come to think of it, I went from being someone who ordered takeout several times a year to that person whose workdays are now marked by the arrival of the food delivery guy at midday.

Like many of us, due to the risks of the pandemic, I limited going out as much as before and so ended up ordering more meals in. 

The convenience of it soon grew on me and before I knew it, I was a regular on my food delivery app with my favourite list of food outlets memorised. 

FOOD DELIVERY FEVER

But it wasn’t just me. The infectiousness of this convenient consumption spread to the rest of the household too.  

On weekends, my children used to ask, “Where are we going for lunch/dinner?”. Now their question is, “What are we ordering?” Instead of some microwaved popcorn and homemade guacamole to go along with the nacho dips, late night snacking for my husband and me now involved popiah and barbecued ribs from our favourite eateries. 

While I welcome the latest innovations in the food delivery space, it is hard not to notice the opportunity costs of ordering in all the time. 

The convenience of ordering food in, and therefore not having to get ready to head out, has given rise to a wider inertia. Days and weeks tend to go by in a blur without the situational reference of having meals with family or colleagues at certain establishments. 

Years from now, I cannot look at my camera roll for a visual reminder about the roti prata breakfast I had with my sister at a famous stall in my neighbourhood, much less recall anything we chatted about. Of course, that is completely my own doing.

MEMORIES OF DISPOSABLE CONTAINERS

Another example: Before the pandemic gave rise to virtual worship services, my husband and I would take the kids out for a meal every Sunday after attending mass in church. 

Even without referring to photos, I remember specific occasions based on the restaurants we ate at as the multi-sensory memory of those places remain etched in my mind: Observations about unique interior décor, the quirky waiter, people at a neighbouring table who talked too loudly, and so on. 

The meals were also telling of different periods in our family life, reflecting how our tastes and preferences evolved over time. The lesser we dine out, the more difficult it is to recognise the differences - as we may find out in years to come as we pour through family albums and find that much of last year and 2021 were spent at home eating out of disposable containers.

No matter how convenient or delicious a delivered meal they are usually better enjoyed with Netflix. For many families like mine, the focal point of a living room gravitates towards what’s on television and that includes mealtimes as well. 

MISSING FAMILY CONVERSATIONS

Moreover, with everyone doing their own thing at home, it is hard to get them to sit down and have a meal all at the same time. 

Family bonding of a deeper kind thus would have to wait for that special occasion when we ate at actual restaurants, where there isn’t a television to distract and mobile devices are kept away. 

When we are all seated around a table at a restaurant with little or no distractions, conversations will happen (even if they are forced).  

Moreover, the comfort and convenience of food delivery services has not been forgiving on the waistline. 

Certainly, the complacency of working in sweatpants and the ease of satisfying food cravings at the touch of a button instead of having to walk to some place to eat can explain the staggering 5kg to 6kg my husband and I have gained since the circuit breaker. 

This sobering wake-up call was what triggered our cutting down on delivered meals and starting a daily ritual of two-hour-long morning walks, which - apart from being energising - turned out to be educational as well. 

As we passed various food centres and coffeeshops, we were able to put a face to the many individual vendors from the food delivery apps. These apps have helped such stalls, many of which are non-descript, reach out to customers like me. Otherwise, we might not have come to know of their delicious offerings. 

STRIKING THE RIGHT BALANCE

On the one hand technology has helped such small business owners explore new income streams. On the other hand, learning who they were and their stories through our walks meant that they were more than just digital integers we clicked on so effortlessly. 

Perhaps that is the kind of balance we need in our lives whenever new innovations or technology emerge to make our lives easier – to not let it dictate our lifestyles, but to incorporate it to improve the lives of others and our own.  That approach is key when it comes to making food ordering decisions as well. 

If there’s anything that my once over-reliance on food delivery has taught me, it’s not to prize convenience and comfort above all else. 

Instead, making space for occasions to take the family to restaurants, to put actual faces to my favourite in-app hawkers, and to generally eat in the company of people instead of devices can be immensely rewarding. 

Food delivery apps are here to stay so we better learn how to live with them and not through them.

COVID-19 vaccinations offered to staff members and students staying in university hostels,"Students and staff members living in autonomous university hostels in Singapore have been offered COVID-19 vaccinations, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Ministry of Education (MOE).

In response to CNA's queries, both ministries said in a joint reply that students and staff members living in autonomous university hostels have been alerted via SMS that they will be offered the jabs.

They will be able to book a slot at the community vaccination centres across the island.  Individuals who are medically eligible to take up the vaccination are strongly encouraged to do so when offered, to safeguard their health and that of the wider community, said the ministries.

MOE and MOH said they had been working on the possibility of prioritising hostel residents for vaccination, given the potential for rapid transmission and outbreaks as a result of the close-density and communal nature of living in the hostels.

The decision to offer the vaccinations to staff members and students living in hostels was made after taking into consideration the relative risks.

Vaccination is critical in the fight against COVID-19, said the ministries.

Given that vaccine supplies continue to be limited, vaccinations are being progressively rolled out to Singaporeans.  

MOH has given priority to individuals at higher risk such as healthcare workers, COVID-19 frontline workers, other vulnerable groups and those living in a communal setting.

MOE also said it would continue to work closely with MOH on how the vaccination programme can be expanded for the rest of the staff members and students in the education sector.

As a precautionary measure, individuals who were at these locations during the specified timings should monitor their health closely for 14 days from the date of their visit.

They should see a doctor promptly if they develop symptoms of acute respiratory infection (such as cough, sore throat and runny nose), as well as fever and loss of taste or smell, and inform the doctor of their exposure history, said the ministry.

There is no need to avoid places where confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been, added MOH.

The National Environment Agency will engage the management of affected premises to provide guidance on cleaning and disinfection.

Singapore on Tuesday reported 13 community cases among 25 new COVID-19 infections.

MOH said the student had been to Raffles Medical at Changi Airport Terminal 3 on Apr 23 and 30 and May 3. She also visited Kopitiam on May 3.

The food court was frequented on May 3 by two other cases in the Changi Airport cluster. They are: Case 62942, a safety coordinator who works at Terminal 3, as well as Case 62945, an aviation officer who works at Terminals 1 and 3.

Cases 62942 and 62945 tested positive for COVID-19 on May 7. The latter is fully vaccinated.

Basement 2 of Terminal 3 - where Kopitiam is located - has been closed temporarily since Monday after several COVID-19 cases visited outlets there, according to airport authorities.

There are now 18 cases linked to the Changi Airport cluster, including the VJC student.

Case 62873, an 88-year-old airport cleaner who tested positive on May 5, was the first case reported in the cluster.

On Tuesday, seven of the 13 new community cases reported were linked to the Changi Airport cluster. There were also 12 imported cases.???????

The VJC student was last in school on May 5. She developed flu-like symptoms after school that day and a fever on May 6.

She visited a general practitioner clinic on May 6 where she was tested for COVID-19. Her test result came back positive the next day.

A total of 95 students and eight staff members who had been in close contact with the student were placed on quarantine order. 

The Ministry of Education (MOE) has also said it will test about 2,200 students, staff, vendors and visitors of the school as a precaution. 

HOME-BASED LEARNING

On Saturday, MOE said that VJC would move to home-based learning for a week from Monday.

VJC Principal Ek Soo Ben said in response to CNA queries that students who are on quarantine order have ready access to the home-based lessons and materials online.

The school implements blended learning regularly and students are familiar with online learning, she added.

The college is also in regular contact with the students on quarantine order, she said.

Our teachers will do a daily check-in with the students at the start of the day to ascertain their well-being and their readiness for lessons.

Teachers will provide additional support for students who may need it, such as one-to-one or small-group consultations online during the period of their quarantine.

As of Tuesday, Singapore has reported a total of 61,403 COVID-19 cases and 31 fatalities.

"Theory test for e-bike, e-scooter riders to cost S$5 during first three months","The mandatory online theory test for e-scooter and e-bike riders will be kept affordable, said Senior Minister of State for Transport Amy Khor in Parliament on Tuesday (May 11).

For the first three months, the test will cost S$5. If the person fails on their first attempt, they can take the test for free a second time.

This is a discounted rate to encourage greater test take-up. Subsequently, the test will be chargeable at $10 for each attempt, said Dr Khor.

Tests fees will be kept affordable to minimise the financial impact on riders of such devices, in particular those who ride for work, she said.

The test will be conducted online in Singapore’s four official languages, said Dr Khor, adding that special provisions can be made on a case-by-case basis for those who are not digitally savvy or illiterate. 

Digital certificates will be issued upon passing the test, she said, stressing that the authorities will have the means to verify unlawful manipulation of the certificate.

“We will provide an adequate transition period for riders to prepare, take and complete the test before enforcement kicks in,” said Dr Khor.

She added that the process for registering and taking the test, including retakes, would be kept simple with minimal turnaround time. 

Dr Khor was speaking during the debate on amendments to the Road Traffic Act, which were passed on Tuesday after almost four hours of debate.

The debate saw 13 Members of Parliament (MPs) seek clarity about the theory test for users of power-assisted bicycles, also known as e-bikes. 

The authorities will work through the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), food delivery companies and active mobility interest groups to raise awareness and ensure all riders are certified before they ride, said Dr Khor.

“It will be an offence for a company to allow an uncertified rider to ride on the road, with the knowledge that the rider is uncertified or being negligent as to whether the rider is uncertified,” she said, responding to a question from MP Desmond Choo (PAP-Tampines) on the issue.

She added she was glad to hear from NMP Abdul Samad Abdul Wahab that NTUC is working on a training programme to prepare delivery riders for the test. 

Mr Abdul Samad - who is vice-president of NTUC - called on the Ministry of Transport's and the Land Transport Authority's (LTA) support in funding such a programme, adding that the NTUC is working with LTA to ensure that questions are manageable for PAB riders to understand and answer. 

Dr Khor said the LTA will provide more details in June, when these tests are expected to start.  

ALTERNATIVE MOTORCYCLE HELMET STANDARDS

Other MPs asked questions about the other aspects of the amendments. 

MP Sharael Taha (PAP-Pasir Ris-Punggol) said he supported the introduction of stiffer penalties for those selling poor quality non-approved helmets.

However, he noted the current high price of testing and approval of helmets could be passed on to riders, deterring them from buying such helmets. He asked if helmet standards other than the current TUV SUD PSB Standard could be accepted. 

He gave examples of standards from the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) and non-profit organisation Snell, already internationally certified as safe. 

In response, Minister of State for Home Affairs Associate Professor Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim noted that Singapore’s current standards are derived in consultation with the industry and technical experts, and were in line with ECE requirements. 

The country has additional requirements, such as a “penetration test”, which tests how easily a helmet is pierced when it hits a sharp object. 

The authorities are aware of the concerns about the cost of certification, but these have to be balanced with ensuring the safety of road users, said Assoc Prof Faishal. 

FRISK SEARCHES

Other MPs, including MP Sylvia Lim (WP-Aljunied) and MP Louis Ng (PAP-Nee Soon), raised concerns regarding the authorisation of “senior approved persons” to conduct frisk searches on public transport under the amendments. 

Stating that the terrorist threat to Singapore “remains serious”, Dr Khor said authorised officers carrying out security searches will have to undergo “proper training” and must complete the necessary Security Workforce Skills Qualification courses approved by the Singapore Police Force before their deployment.

All authorised officers have to be in uniform when performing such searches, she said.

In addition, security searches will be conducted within the video surveillance coverage, to provide assurance to the public that any alleged abuses will be investigated accordingly. 

To safeguard the modesty of a female person and to ensure frisk searches are conducted professionally, only authorised female officers can conduct frisk searches on a female person, said Dr Khor, adding that the authorities have the powers to enforce against imposters, as provided under the LTA Act.

A slew of other amendments to the Road Traffic Act were also passed on Tuesday, including increasing penalties for offences such as illegal speed trials, which will see first-time offenders face up to a year in jail and up to S$5,000 in fines. 

People who take the fall for another driver who committed an offence will now face penalties. Those who are convicted of doing so are liable to be jailed for up to a year or fined up to S$10,000, or both."
Singapore police arrest man and woman over death of newborn baby in Taiwan 2 years ago,"The Singapore police have arrested a man and a woman over their suspected involvement in the death of a newborn baby in Taiwan two years ago.

The man and woman, both 25, were arrested on Apr 28, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) told CNA in response to queries.

SPF said it received a request for assistance from Taiwanese authorities after a newborn baby was found dead at a waste management facility in Taipei on Feb 26, 2019.

“Since then, the police have been working with the Taiwanese authorities to review the evidence and have commenced investigations,” said SPF.

“We are unable to comment further as investigations are ongoing.”

BABY'S BODY FOUND IN BLACK PLASTIC BAG

Taiwan police told CNA in March 2019 that the Singaporean couple flew into Taiwan on Feb 19, 2019 and left on Feb 26, 2019.

The body of the baby girl was found in a black plastic bag by a recycling company employee, who had discovered it while sorting through rubbish collected from across Taipei, local reports said in 2019.

Investigations showed that the baby was originally dumped into a kitchen waste basket in central Taipei's Ximending district.

CCTV footage showed that a man had thrown the bag into the bin.

Tests have determined that the bloodstains found in the Taipei hotel room reportedly booked by the Singaporean couple are a match to the DNA of the baby, Taiwan police told CNA in March 2019.

The couple were placed on a wanted list by Taiwanese authorities in February this year, Lianhe Zaobao reported."

The woman, who is of Indian ethnicity, was walking along a walkway at Choa Chu Kang Drive at about 8.45am on May 7 when she was confronted by a Chinese couple to wear her mask properly, the SPF said in a news release.

“She purportedly got into a verbal exchange with the man. The man allegedly uttered an offensive racial remark and assaulted her, causing her to fall to the ground,” the police said.

The couple then left the scene and the woman was assisted by a member of the public.

Investigations are ongoing, said the police.

For uttering words with deliberate intent to wound the racial feelings of any person, the punishment is an imprisonment term of up to three years, a fine, or both.

The offence of voluntary causing hurt carries an imprisonment term of up to three years, a fine of up to S$5,000, or both.

The police take a serious view of such acts that have the potential to damage racial harmony in Singapore, said SPF.

Any person who makes remarks or takes action that can cause ill-will and hostility between the different races will be dealt with swiftly and in accordance with the law, it added."
"SportSG to set aside S$18m to help gyms, studios affected by latest COVID-19 restrictions","SportSG will set aside up to S$18 million under the Sports Resilience Package for eligible businesses and self-employed persons affected by the latest COVID-19 guidelines, it said in a press release on Tuesday (May 11).

This follows a tightening of measures which has meant that only low-intensity physical activities are allowed to continue at indoor gyms and fitness studios.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
The new measures are intended to help defray operating costs for the affected businesses and support the affected self-employed persons during this period, preserve core capabilities, as well as catalyse the industry to encourage Singaporeans to continue to stay active, said SportSG in a media release.

The S$18 million falls under the S$25 million top-up to the package that was announced earlier this year. The total amount of COVID-19 support measures under this package currently stands at S$75 million.

One of the measures aimed to support those affected will be the S$7.7 million sport and fitness operating grant.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
This will provide additional support for more than 500 entities, in particular gyms and fitness studios, said SportSG.

Eligible entities will receive a one-time disbursement ranging from S$5,000 to S$100,000 for the three-week period. The amount of support disbursed takes into account overhead costs such as rental and salaries.

In addition, the self-employed persons project grant, which was first announced at this year's Committee of Supply debate, will see its grant quantum increased from S$2.5 million to S$7.5 million. This means it can support an estimated 300 projects, up from the previous 100, said SportSG.

Successful grant applicants may obtain up to S$25,000 in funding per project.

S$2.8 million has been also set aside for the sport and fitness self-employed persons support fund, which will disburse a one-time cash assistance of up to S$400 for those eligible and have experienced at least 50 per cent income loss during the three weeks, added SportSG.

Fitness instructors can also apply for the continuing coach education training allowance grant, said SportSG.

This will allow them to actively engage in continuous learning and be current in their knowledge and skills during this period. 

Eligible instructors may claim S$7.50 for each claimable hour for the continuing coach education training/event up to a maximum of S$300 per person until Mar 31, 2022

“The stricter measures are necessary to contain the spread of COVID-19. We understand the impact it has on the sport and fitness industry which plays an integral role in encouraging health and wellness among Singaporeans, said SportSG chief executive officer Lim Teck Yin.

We have been engaging business owners and professionals in these sectors to better understand their challenges. We have developed these additional support measures to help them cushion the impact during this period of closure. We urge everyone to rally and work together in guarding against COVID-19 spread.” "
"Man who evaded payment for massages, facials, ear wax removal gets jail","A man went for beauty treatments including a shave, blackhead removal and ear wax services worth hundreds of dollars despite knowing that he could not pay for them.

 

Raymond Kang Han Tiong, 40, was given nine months and two weeks' jail on Tuesday (May 11) for four counts of cheating, with another three charges taken into consideration. He will have to serve an additional enhanced sentence of 237 days' jail as he was on remission for previous offences when he reoffended.

The court heard that Kang was released from prison on Jul 30, 2020 but was placed on remission for previous offences that include cheating.

He began reoffending soon after his release.

On the night of Aug 9, 2020, he boarded a taxi with a female friend at 100 Upper Cross Street. He got the driver to drop his friend off before continuing the journey to his home.

The total fare was S$31.50. Kang left his NRIC behind with the cabby, promising to return to make payment but failed to do so. The taxi driver later called the police.

On Sep 13, 2020, Kang visited Ruby Beauty Centre at The Bencoolen in the Rochor area.

Kang ordered services worth S$956 at the shop: A collagen recharge facial treatment for S$278, facial hair shaving for S$138 and blackhead removal for S$540.

After the services were rendered, Kang gave various excuses and said he could not pay, requesting to pay another time. He never paid the victim.

On Oct 4, 2020, Kang visited a shop called Yan Mei Shan along Jalan Sultan and ordered a 60-minute foot massage and a 90-minute body massage with essential oils for S$140. 

When it was time to make payment, Kang again said he did not have money to do so.

A friend of his paid the shop on his behalf the next day.

That same night on Oct 4, 2020, Kang went to a hair salon in Geylang Road and asked for a S$7 hair cut, a S$15 ear-waxing service and a S$48 hair treatment.

After he received the services, he said he did not have the money and could not pay for them. He was eventually arrested and later remanded.

RECALCITRANT OFFENDER: PROSECUTOR

Deputy Public Prosecutor Sean Koh asked for at least 10 months' jail and an enhanced sentence of 237 days.

He said Kang is a recalcitrant offender with convictions dating back to 1998. He had committed similar cheating offences in 2018 by going to various karaoke lounges and ordering packages he could not afford.

His lawyer asked for a lower sentence, saying that it should still not be too far off from similar cases of this nature, but the judge agreed with the prosecution's position, saying that Kang has a lot of past convictions.

For each count of cheating, he could have been jailed for up to three years, fined, or both. Because he committed the offences while on remission, he was liable for enhanced sentences."
In full: Lawrence Wong's ministerial statement on whole-of-government response to COVID-19,"Education Minister Lawrence Wong on Tuesday (May 11) delivered a ministerial statement in Parliament on Singapore's whole-of-government response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Mr Wong, who is co-chair of the multi-ministry task force dealing with COVID-19, said the country is on knife-edge, with community case numbers that could go either way in the next few weeks.

This is his full speech:

Mr Speaker sir, we’ve been fighting this virus for more than a year. We’ve said this is a marathon, not a sprint. Really, no one knows how long the pandemic will go on for. Vaccination is key to ending the pandemic. But it will take a very long time to vaccinate the world.

Meanwhile, the virus is not waiting for us. It is changing and mutating quickly. New variants are spreading faster than the current pace of vaccinations worldwide – these variants are more infectious, and potentially more virulent and more resistant to the current vaccines.

So there’s still a long road ahead of us in this fight against COVID-19. We don’t know how the path of the pandemic will evolve. We must be mentally prepared for a long road ahead with many curveballs, and many more twists and turns.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
One scenario is that the virus will never go away. It becomes endemic to the human population. We will then have to learn to live with it.

At a personal level, this means we try to lead our lives as normally as we can, but manage the impact of the virus – by getting vaccinated every year, and taking sensible precautions.

As a country and economy, we will then continue to connect with the world to earn a living – but we set up strong border defences, establish protocols for safe business travel, partner safe countries to open up our borders, and keep hospitalisations and fatalities as low as possible.

We are not there yet, but we are planning ahead, looking at different scenarios of how the pandemic will unfold, and preparing our drawer plans and responses.
Advertisement
In this journey, we are bound to face some bumps and setbacks. We worked together to overcome some of these difficult challenges last year. After we exited the circuit breaker, we set out a three Phase roadmap to re-open our economy and resume activities.

We highlighted then that this re-opening process was not going to be a straightforward one, and that there would be potential stops and starts along the way.

Because the virus has not been eradicated in our community, and new cases can leak through our borders despite our precautions and safeguards. So the more we open up, and the more activities we undertake, the higher the risks of new cases breaking out in the community.

SINGAPORE'S APPROACH ON BORDER MEASURES

So how do we manage COVID-19 and protect both lives and livelihoods under these difficult circumstances? Several Members (Mr Yip Hon Weng, Mr Don Wee, Mr Alex Yam, Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Ms Jessica Tan, Mr Saktiandi Supaat, Mr Leong Mun Wai and Mr Seah Kian Peng) have raised questions about our border measures, so let me provide some perspectives.

One option is to shut our borders and minimise the flow of people into Singapore. Larger, continental-sized or resource-rich countries like China, Australia and New Zealand have taken this approach. They are able to keep things going with their own resources and people, and sustain a living with their own domestic demand.

But Singapore is in a completely different position. We are a little red dot fully plugged into the world. Trade and travel are our lifeblood – for us, these are not just good-to-have; they are existential issues. They are how, as a country, we earn a living and, remain relevant to the world.

In other words, we can keep our borders closed for a short time, but not over a prolonged duration. And that’s why after we exited the circuit breaker last year, we also progressively lifted our travel restrictions, and allowed travellers to come in, but in a controlled and safe manner.

We recognised then there would be a risk of some imported cases leaking into the community. And so we have taken several steps to strengthen our precautions and safeguards.

For example, we put in place a system of regular testing for those working at the checkpoints and borders. We prioritised vaccination for them and those working in our stay-home notice facilities. So vaccination rates are now above 90 per cent for aviation and maritime; and 85 per cent for the stay-home notice facilities.

We stepped up our testing protocols with pre-departure and on-arrival polymerase chain reaction tests. We tightened our stay-home notice regime – ensured that the hotels we use for stay-home notice have proper infection controls and security measures.

We also continue to update the stay-home notice regime to respond to the evolving public health situation here and abroad. Some members have suggested extending the stay-home notice to 21 days.

Indeed we did so initially for the incoming construction, marine and process (CMP) workers, because they would be living and working in higher-risk settings. So these workers would serve out 14 days in the SHN facility, followed by seven days in the migrant worker on-boarding centres.

We also applied a 21-day stay-home notice for arrivals from the few countries where the variant strains originated from – the United Kingdom, South Africa, and India. But these strains are now circulating everywhere in the world, so it has increasingly become difficult to target just countries where the strains originated from.

I should clarify that there is still no evidence that the new variants have a longer incubation period. But variant or not, there is always a very small tail risk of such long incubation cases. And that’s why we have moved recently to a tighter 21-day stay-home notice regime for travellers from all higher-risk countries during this period of heightened alert.

Ms Nadia Samdin asked if it is possible for vaccinated citizens and permanent residents who travel abroad to serve their stay-home-notice at home.

At this stage, we prefer to take a more cautious approach and have all travellers from higher-risk countries serve the stay-home-notice in dedicated facilities. But we will continue to review and consider options for the future, especially as we gain a better understanding of the new variants and when more of our population is vaccinated.

Mr Yip Hon Weng also asked about the business travellers who do not need to serve stay-home notice.

We have explained before that we allow a small group of such travellers for essential work reasons. We control the risks tightly by keeping the numbers small, and requiring them to adhere strictly to a controlled itinerary.

We also subject them to frequent testing while they are in Singapore to ensure they are free from the virus. The scope and usage of such travel passes are subject to constant review and close monitoring, to ensure they are used in a safe manner, while minimising the risks to the community.

Importantly, besides the stay-home notice and testing protocols, we control tightly the overall flow of travellers coming into Singapore. This is a dynamic process – we adjust the travel flows from each country regularly based on our assessment of the public health situation.

Once we observe any deterioration in any country or region, we will throttle down the numbers and impose stricter border restrictions for that country or region. And that was the approach we took recently because of the rapidly deteriorating COVID-19 situation in India.

In April we reduced entry approvals for long-term pass holders and short-term visitors from India. Later we moved to ban all travellers from India. This ban was extended to the entire South Asian region from the start of May.

Let me share some numbers to provide a better perspective. Pre-COVID, we had 200,000 travellers coming through Changi Airport every day, both on transit as well as entering Singapore. This plummeted during the circuit breaker when we closed our borders temporarily.

After the circuit breaker as I mentioned, we eased some of our travel restrictions. By November last year we had about 820 arrivals a day, compared to 200,000 transit and arrivals. Between December and March this year, the figure has been stable at about 1,200 arrivals per day.

One reason for the increase in arrivals is that we had taken in more migrant workers for the CMP sectors as well as foreign domestic workers (FDWs). This group was also the largest contributor to our imported cases – they account for about 40 per cent of the imported cases over the recent six months.

But even as we increased the flow of these workers, we also implemented a tighter screening and quarantine process for them. So these imported cases were already in stay-home notice when we detected them, and they were not in contact with the community.

But the inflow of CMP workers we’ve allowed up to now is still unable to meet our needs. Because every day, every week, every month, many migrant workers have left to go back to their home countries. Whatever numbers we are bringing in barely replace those who have left.

Our companies including many SMEs urgently need new workers to make up the shortfall, and have been applying to MOM for approval to enter Singapore as you heard just now in the Parliamentary Question posed to Minister Tan See Leng.

The application backlog has been building up significantly, even before we imposed the latest set of travel restrictions on the South Asian region. And now the manpower crunch has worsened.

IMPACT OF BORDER CONTROLS

Now I fully understand and share the desire amongst many to be tight on our border measures; in fact we have maintained a tight posture as I have explained, and will continue to do so. But we also need to be very clear what this means for Singapore and Singaporeans.

Contractors will be especially hard hit. Building projects will (be) delayed. In particular, we can expect many new BTO projects to be delayed by one year or more. Private home buyers may also face delays of varying lengths.

Likewise companies in the marine and process sectors will be badly affected. They will find it hard to deliver their existing projects on time, and a few may even have to forgo new opportunities and projects.

These are important sectors that we have taken decades to build – they hire thousands of Singaporean engineers and executives, and they remain crucial sources of highly-skilled jobs.

The manpower shortage will not be confined to the CMP sector. It will have a cascading effect on the whole economy. In fact, any company seeking to bring in workers from higher-risk countries will now face considerable delays – the waiting time for an entry approval could be more than six months.

And our big concern is that if companies continue to face difficulties or are forced to close, we could then end up with higher unemployment and job losses for Singaporeans.

Stresses will be felt in our society too. Singaporeans will find it harder to reunite with their families abroad. Families applying for new FDWs to care for their children or elderly will have to wait for at least two months.

These are the consequences of keeping our borders tight, and I hope Members in this House will help to explain this to your constituents when you receive appeals, be it to shut our borders completely, or to relax the restrictions to allow their workers or FDWs to come in.

Meanwhile, the Government will do more to assist the CMP sector which is bearing the brunt of the impact. The industry has been working very hard to become more manpower lean. But this will take time.

That’s why MND has set out new legislation to allow existing construction contracts to be adjusted to take into account the increase in manpower costs. We are debating that later.

As announced recently, CMP firms will receive higher foreign worker levy rebates from May to December 2021. The rebate for each work permit holder will be increased from S$90 per month to S$250 per month. We will also continue to work with the CMP employers to find safe ways to bring in workers to alleviate the manpower shortage.

Beyond the CMP sector, as well as the aviation and tourism-related segments, there are signs of improvement in the broader economy. Barring a setback to the global economy, and provided we are able to keep the COVID-19 situation under control, we should be able to continue with our recovery trajectory.

But things are very fluid and the outlook remains uncertain. The Government will continue to keep a close watch over the economic situation, and consider how best to support those who need more help to adjust.

At the same time, businesses will also need to be more agile, and to start factoring (in) the need to pivot plans or operating models at short notice. We will all need to learn to adapt quickly and be more nimble in this new uncertain and rapidly changing environment.

COMMUNITY MEASURES

Even with the tightest of border controls, there may still be imported cases leaking into the community. I shared earlier that countries like China and Australia have adopted a tighter border regime than us because they can afford to rely on a larger base of domestic resources and demand. But even these countries have detected cases of new variants in their communities.

So we cannot just rely on border measures to keep out the virus; we also need to have a full suite of protective measures and safeguards in our community. When a new case pops up, we move in quickly to isolate all the close contacts and ring-fence them.

As we have been doing, we cast a wide net and conduct mass testing for all persons with possible exposures to the infected case, like what you see recently when we went in quickly to test everyone in the school, or everyone working at the airport. And thus, we try our best to prevent large clusters and outbreaks from happening.

Despite these efforts, there will be a few occasions when we will need more general movement restrictions. For example, with the recent Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) cluster, the transmission was detected some time after the virus was introduced into the ward. We’ve tested all the TTSH staff, patients as well as visitors to the hospital and tried to ring-fence the cluster.

But we could not be sure if there were still hidden cases out there in the community. That’s why we decided to tighten the overall rules preemptively – to reduce our movement and social contacts more generally, so that we can reduce the risks of transmission and curb any further spread of the virus.

I recognise that these measures pose considerable inconvenience to Singaporeans. As Minister Gan (Kim Yong) said just now, there are several public holidays coming up in the month of May. Many activities and plans have had to be adjusted.

I know in particular this must be very hard for our Malay/Muslim community – having to observe these strict rules during Hari Raya, and to curtail your normal family visits for a second year. Likewise for the Buddhist community during Vesak Day.

I hope everyone understands why these measures are necessary. I thank everyone for taking the latest measures in your stride and seek your cooperation to abide by them – not just with the letter of the law but also the spirit of it.

I think it is very important for us to understand that we are now on knife-edge and our community case numbers can go either way over the next few weeks. We have a chance of getting things under control by the end of the month.

But as we know from experience, it only takes one lapse or one irresponsible action for an infection to spread; and that infection may end up being a super-spreader event in the community. So let’s all do our part – work from home, cut back on social activities and interactions, and stay home as much as possible during this period.

CONCLUSION

This is not the first time we’ve had to deal with spikes in community cases. But compared to a year ago, our capabilities have significantly strengthened.

Our testing capacity is much larger – we tested about 35,000 swabs per day in the past week, and have the lab capacity to test up to 73,000 per day, or even more with pooled testing. TraceTogether and Safe Entry are now more pervasive, which means we can contact trace and ring-fence cases more quickly.

We are also regularly testing persons in higher-risk settings and undertaking surveillance testing for symptomatic individuals, which is how we uncovered many of the cases reported over the recent days.

Importantly, vaccination is a major game changer. We haven’t vaccinated everyone yet, but we have covered most of our older population as well as our healthcare and frontline workers at the air and sea ports and our stay-home notice hotels and dormitories. This puts us in a much safer position.

Our experiences over the last year have shown that if we act swiftly to contract trace, isolate, test, and if we all exercise individual and social responsibility, we can effectively suppress the spread of the virus. We’ve brought down infection rates in the community before, and we can do it again.

We must also continue to support one another. Many have been fighting COVID-19 for more than a year. For example, our healthcare professionals testing, vaccinating and treating patients; our contact tracing teams; our public officers across multiple Government agencies; our safe distancing ambassadors and enforcement officers, and many, many more serving on the frontline.

It has been very tough for all of them. So to them we say thank you. Keep your spirits up and all of us are behind you every step of the way.

The best way to support our frontline workers is to take all the prevailing measures seriously – do your part to reduce the risks of transmission, and when vaccination is offered to you, take it up as soon as possible.

Avoid spreading falsehoods or unverified information that can cause needless fear, or foster divisions and suspicions in our society. Remember the virus does not respect ethnicity or nationality. This is not a Chinese virus or an Indian variant.

This is a global pandemic – the virus and its variants are out there everywhere in the world. So there is no place for discrimination, racism or xenophobia here in Singapore. We must continue to stand together, look out for each other, so that we can all get through this together.

Mr Speaker, working together over the past year, our overall situation has improved. Yes, we’ve had our share of setbacks, but we’ve learnt and we’ve bounced back from them. Importantly we’ve seen the Singapore spirit shine brightly throughout these challenging times.

So let’s draw confidence from what we have been through; let’s brace ourselves for the rest of the marathon, complete the race together, and emerge stronger at the finish line.

"13 new community COVID-19 cases, including operating theatre technician at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital","Thirteen community cases were among 25 new COVID-19 infections reported in Singapore as of noon on Tuesday (May 11), said the Ministry of Health (MOH).

Seven of the 13 new community cases are linked to the Changi Airport cluster, while three are unlinked. The remaining three cases are linked to previous cases.

UNLINKED COMMUNITY CASES

Of the three unlinked community cases, one is a 27-year-old Malaysian man who works as a manufacturing operator at Siltronic Singapore.

He had not gone to work after the onset of symptoms. On May 6, he developed body aches and sought medical treatment at a general practitioner clinic on the same day, and he was given two days' medical leave.

On May 8, he developed a fever and cough and sought treatment at another general practitioner clinic at night. He was tested for COVID-19 on May 9, and his result came back positive the next day. His serology test result is negative.

In response to CNA's queries, Siltronic Singapore said on Wednesday that a small team of the man's co-workers have since been put on quarantine order.

The work area of the affected staff member and other common areas have been disinfected.

We continue to apply strict COVID prevention measures to ensure continuity of our operations including precautionary swab tests, team separation protocols, additional cleanings, enforcing social distancing and wearing masks, Siltronic Singapore told CNA. 

At this point in time, there is no impact to our production. Our top priority is the health and safety of our employees, customers, contractors and communities.

The second unlinked case is a 50-year-old permanent resident who works as an IT support staff member at Kulicke and Soffa. He also works part-time as a barista at Starbucks at Plaza Singapura and as a general worker at LBC Express at Lucky Plaza.

He developed a cough and shortness of breath on May 6, but did not seek medical treatment, said MOH.

On the night of May 8, as his symptoms had persisted, he went to a general practitioner clinic, where he was tested for COVID-19 the next day. His test result came back positive on May 10.

His serology test result is negative. He received his first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine on Apr 24 and has not received his second dose.

In response to CNA's queries, Starbucks said on Wednesday that the employee was last at work on May 6.

The store at Plaza Singapura has undergone deep cleaning and will remain closed until further notice, said the company.

The firm stopped cross deployment of employees between stores in April last year to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

We will continue to monitor the situation and will be taking any necessary actions, including working closely with the local authorities, said Starbucks.

The third unlinked case is a 42-year-old Malaysian man who works as an operating theatre technician at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (NTFGH).

He returned to Singapore on Jan 10 after a trip to Malaysia, and served his stay-home notice until Jan 24. His test taken on Jan 23 during the stay-home notice period was negative for COVID-19.

He developed a cough on Apr 21, but did not seek medical treatment, said MOH. His cough worsened and on May 10, he sought medical treatment at the hospital’s staff clinic, where he was tested for COVID-19. His test result came back positive on the same day. 

His Ct value was very high, which is indicative of a low viral load and his serology test result has come back positive. He could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA from a past infection which are no longer transmissible and infective to others, said the Health Ministry.

However given that we are not able to definitively conclude when he had been infected, we will take all the necessary public health actions as a precautionary measure.

In a Facebook post early on Wednesday morning, JurongHealth Campus said it has taken the necessary safety precautions including disinfecting all areas which the staff has been in contact with. 

The man is currently warded in an isolation room at the hospital, and his household contacts have been swabbed, JurongHealth Campus added. 

He has not been in contact with any known clusters or Tan Tock Seng Hospital staff.

We will continue to provide full support to our colleague and continue to enforce strict precautionary measures and infection control protocols to keep our patients, visitors and staff safe.

LINKED COMMUNITY CASES

Three community cases reported on Tuesday are linked to previous infections.

The first is a 72-year-old Singaporean who is a retiree. He is a family member and household contact of Case 62969, a 38-year-old Grab driver who tested preliminarily positive for the B1617 COVID-19 variant first detected in India.

As he had been identified as a close contact of Case 62969, he was placed on quarantine on May 8. The next day, he developed a cough but did not report his symptoms to MOH. 

On May 10, he was tested for COVID-19 during quarantine and his result came back positive the next day. His serology test result is pending. He received his first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine on Feb 23, and the second dose on Mar 16.

The second case is a 48-year-old Singaporean woman who works as a relief school library assistant, but had not gone to work after the onset of symptoms. 

She is the wife of Case 63005, a 47-year-old Singaporean man working as a landscaper at NParks.

As she had been identified as a close contact of Case 63005, she was placed on quarantine on May 8, and was tested for COVID-19 on May 10 during quarantine. On the same day, she developed a fever, cough and body aches. 

Her test result came back positive the next day. Her serology test result is pending.

In response to queries from CNA, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said on Wednesday that the woman was last at work on May 7.

She was wearing a mask and practised safe distancing throughout her time at work. As a precautionary measure, the areas that she had visited in school before the onset of symptoms have been cleaned and disinfected, said an MOE spokesperson. 

As there was minimal risk of her being infectious while in school, MOH did not require any student or staff member to be quarantined or swabbed, said the MOE spokesperson.

MOE did not state which school the woman had worked at.

The third linked community case is a 54-year-old Indonesian man who is a sea crew member working on board bunker tanker MT ALLI. He had not disembarked from the vessel, except to be taken to a dedicated quarantine facility.

As he had been identified as a close contact of Case 62113 - another Indonesian national on the same bunker tanker who tested positive on Apr 16 - he was placed on quarantine on Apr 25. 

He was tested during quarantine on May 9 and his result came back positive for COVID-19. His serology test is negative.

CHANGI AIRPORT CLUSTER

The remaining seven community cases are connected to the Changi Airport cluster. There are now 18 cases linked to the Changi Airport cluster.

Of the seven new cases linked to the cluster, three are family members or household contacts of previous cases.

One of the cases is the wife of an aviation officer at Changi Airport Terminals 1 and 3, while another is a family member and household contact of an aviation security officer who is employed by Certis Cisco and works at the airport.

The third case, Case 63061, is a household contact of a cleaner who works at the airport. Case 63061 is a 43-year-old Chinese national who is employed by EM Services and deployed as a housekeeper at Changi General Hospital.

The remaining four cases work at the airport.

Additionally, MOH's investigations revealed that a Victoria Junior College student who tested positive for COVID-19 last week is linked to the Changi Airport cluster. 

She had been at Raffles Medical at Changi Airport Terminal 3 on Apr 23, Apr 30 and May 3. 

The student also visited Kopitiam at Terminal 3's Basement 2 on May 3, the same day two other cases had visited the same food court.

She was likely to have been infected while she was at Changi Airport Terminal 3 on May 3, said MOH.

IMPORTED CASES

The remaining 12 new COVID-19 cases reported on Tuesday were imported and were placed on stay-home notice upon their arrival in Singapore, said the Health Ministry.

Three of the imported cases are Singaporeans and two are permanent residents who returned from India, Malaysia and the UK.

One is a dependant's pass holder who arrived from Indonesia, while three are work pass holders who arrived from Indonesia, the Philippines and Sri Lanka.

One is a work permit holder who arrived from India.

The remaining two are short-term visit pass holders - one arrived from Japan for a work project in Singapore, and the other arrived from Indonesia to visit her family member who is a permanent resident.

The arrivals from the Indian sub-continent had already come into Singapore before the restrictions on travel were imposed, the Health Ministry said.

No new infections were reported in foreign workers' dormitories.

RECOVERIES

Twenty-two more people have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, taking the total recoveries to 60,975.

There are 144 cases who are still in hospital. Most are stable or improving, and three are in critical condition in the intensive care unit. 

A total of 253 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. They have mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19.

As of Tuesday, Singapore has reported a total of 61,403 COVID-19 cases and 31 fatalities.

About 9,000 workers from Terminal 1, Terminal 3 and Jewel Changi Airport are undergoing mandatory tests for COVID-19.

Terminal 3's Basement 2 has also been temporarily closed to the public after several COVID-19 cases visited outlets there.

Singapore is now on a knife-edge, with community case numbers that could go either way over the next few weeks, said Education Minister Lawrence Wong, co-chair of Singapore's COVID-19 multi-ministry task force, on Tuesday.

While Singapore has a chance of “getting things under control” by the end of the month, it only takes one lapse or one irresponsible action for an infection to happen, said Mr Wong in a ministerial statement in Parliament.

That infection may end up being a super-spreader event in the community, he added.

He said that “a full suite” of protective community measures is needed, as even the tightest of border controls might still see imported cases leaking into the country.

As of May 9, about 1.8 million people in Singapore have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, with 1.2 million of them receiving their second dose, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong in Parliament on Tuesday.

Mr Gan said that the benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines continue to outweigh the known risks, adding that there remains a need to encourage Singaporeans to be vaccinated.

As of Monday, 30 local fully vaccinated cases have tested positive for COVID-19, noted Mr Gan. 

Most of our local cases of infected vaccinated individuals were asymptomatic. None had severe COVID-19 disease requiring more intensive care, said the Health Minister in his ministerial statement.

Singapore will fail if racism and xenophobia take root: Shanmugam,"Singapore will fail if the country allows racism and xenophobia to become prevalent, said Minister for Law and Home Affairs K Shanmugam on Tuesday (May 11).

Mr Shanmugam was responding in Parliament to a question from Mr Murali Pillai (PAP-Bukit Batok), who pointed to an incident last Friday when a 55-year-old woman of Indian descent had allegedly been kicked in the chest and subject to racial slurs for not wearing a mask while brisk walking. 

AdvertisementAdvertisement
The alleged assault - which is currently being investigated by the police - drew condemnation from several ministers, including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who said it “goes against everything that our multiracial society stands for”. 

Mr Murali asked Mr Shanmugam for his assessment of “the security situation arising from this racial incident connected with the pandemic”, and what steps the authorities would take to address the situation. 

Noting investigations need to be done before conclusions can be drawn, the minister said the attack appeared to be racist based on the victim’s claims. 
AdvertisementAdvertisement
This was consistent with other cases of racism that had risen internationally amid the pandemic, he said, pointing to incidents in the United States where Asians - particularly Chinese - were attacked for supposedly spreading COVID-19. 

Such behaviour should be condemned, said Mr Shanmugam.

Singapore has been able to manage racism and over time “sought to reduce it”, he said, though this has been stirred up recently. 

“Around the world economic pressures have led to populism and the populists have been seeking political profit by exploiting people's fears over jobs and economic insecurity, blaming foreigners, blaming immigrants, for all of their country's problems,” he said. 

While Singapore has avoided the worst of such populist attitudes, there are legitimate concerns about foreigners taking jobs from locals, said Mr Shanmugam. 

These have been fuelled by unacceptable practices, he said. 

“For example, unfair employment practices that favour hiring foreigners and discriminate against our locals. It is a minority who behave like this, but it naturally makes Singaporeans unhappy,” he said, adding that the Manpower Ministry has taken steps to deal with such practices. 

On top of this, Mr Shanmugam said that certain parties - which he did not identify - had been “deliberately stoking the fears, encouraging racism and xenophobia, and dog whistling”, which is “dangerous for Singapore”.

“Because first, it will be the expat Indians. Then, it will come to Singaporean Indians,” he said, noting not all would be able to distinguish between Indians born in Singapore and those born overseas. 

“The lady who was attacked has been a citizen for 25 years. If we go down this route, eventually all Indians can be a target of hate,” he said, suggesting this could create an “outgroup” based on race.

“The majority of Singaporeans are decent and not racist, but if we continue to fan the flames of racism, we will get to a more uncomfortable position,” he said. 

Mr Shanmugam pointed to certain websites which were anti-government - which he said was “perfectly okay” - but also deliberately fomented racism, with comments describing Indians as “cockroaches” and “rapists”.

“We should be ashamed that in the name of free speech, we allow such comments,” he said. 

“This bad behaviour and open expression of racism – I invite all here to condemn.”

Such racist behaviour cannot be justified by saying “the Indians are behaving badly” or blamed on Government policies such as the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA), he said. 

“There have been several canards about CECA, promoted by a whispering campaign,” he said, adding that any Members of Parliament who believed the agreement was a problem could put up a Motion for debate.

He singled out Non-Constituency MP Leong Mun Wai, who had previously said he was “deeply disappointed” that DBS Bank did not have a “homegrown” chief executive and whose Progress Singapore Party (PSP) had called for agreements such as CECA to be reviewed. 

“I am looking at you, Mr Leong. I invite you to put up a Motion to debate CECA. You know that most of what is said about CECA is false,” he said. 

Racist comments could become normalised if the country is not careful, said Mr Shanmugam.

“I hope responsible opposition parties will take a stand on this, notwithstanding that many of these sites that promote xenophobia support you.”

Mr Leong later responded by saying neither he nor the PSP were xenophobic.

“We are just stating the economic effects (that) some of these free trade agreements have had on our economy,” he said, adding he intended to take up the challenge from Mr Shanmugam for a debate at “an appropriate time in the future”. 

Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh later said the Workers’ Party was in agreement with Mr Shanmugam’s statement.

“There is no place for racism in Singapore - no ifs, no buts,” he said. 

Closing his speech, Mr Shanmugam said: “Singapore is 725 sq km of rock. We have to make a living by being open to the world.

“We will fail if we allow racism and xenophobia to become prevalent, and it's contrary to everything that has made us successful and proud to be Singaporean.”"
"Singapore reviewing if more can be done to help firms hit by labour crunch, entry curbs: Tan See Leng","Authorities are “very mindful” of the labour crunch that companies in the construction, marine shipyard and process sectors are facing, and will continue to review if additional support measures are needed, said Second Minister for Manpower Tan See Leng on Tuesday (May 11).

These sectors, which are heavily reliant on migrant workers, have borne the brunt of COVID-19 restrictions, including a recent ban on long-term pass holders and short-term visitors from India where the outbreak has worsened.

AdvertisementAdvertisement
Speaking in Parliament, Dr Tan said the number of work permit holders in the construction, marine shipyard and process sectors fell by nearly 60,000, or 16 per cent, last year.

Providing a further breakdown from March 2020 to April 2021, these sectors saw an average net outflow of 2,400 work permit and S Pass holders monthly. Among these, 1,800 workers were from the construction sector.

The services sector lost about 42,000 workers over the same period, representing a net outflow of 3,200 per month.

Altogether, these sectors are seeing a net outflow of 5,600 workers a month, said Dr Tan.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
Authorities have taken steps to alleviate the manpower shortage, by granting entry approvals to an average of 5,100 work permit and S Pass holders every month from November 2020 to April 2021.

But restrictions on workers from higher-risk countries are likely to persist for some time”, he said. 

“This is as the size of the inflows coming in has to be reduced when the COVID 19 situation deteriorates in these source countries … and we can only increase these inflows when the situation in these home countries improve,” Dr Tan told the House.

“Because this is the only way we can ensure a safe inflow of the workers whilst managing and mitigating the risk of transmission in our community.”

More recently, higher foreign-worker levy rebates were announced for companies in the hard-hit sectors. The rebate for each work permit holder in the construction, marine shipyard and process sectors will go up from S$90 to S$250 per month from May to December. 

Construction firms will also get more flexibility to hire workers from China and more time to complete public sector projects as part of support measures announced last month.

“The Building & Construction Authority (BCA) and Economic Development Board will continue to engage firms and we will continue to review if additional measures are needed to help the construction, marine shipyard and process sectors through this crisis,” said Dr Tan.

“In the meantime, we encourage businesses to retain their existing migrant workers and tap on other workers that are already here in Singapore.”

Authorities are also looking at workers from non-traditional source countries, but “this will take time”, said Dr Tan.

“For the diversification of source countries, the different ministries … are exploring that collectively and we have started to reach out to counterparts in many of these other source countries – the non-traditional sources – to see how we can onboard them,” he said in response to a question from Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh.

“But obviously, I think this will take time because there are also language and cultural issues. These are things that we have to take into consideration.”

The “automatic” extension of in-principal approvals (IPAs) for foreign workers is also under review, said Dr Tan in reply to a separate question from Mr Singh.

Mr Singh cited anecdotes of companies facing repeated unsuccessful applications for the entry permits of their workers who have been issued with IPAs. He noted that the IPAs are currently given an automatic extension and asked if this is set to continue and how long will these extensions be.

An IPA is one of the requirements for employers recruiting foreign workers to Singapore. It is issued when a work permit is approved, and employers have to bring the workers in during the validity period stated on the document.

The validity of these IPAs differs based on the type of work permit, said Dr Tan.

At the moment, IPAs are issued as long as the applications fulfil existing requirements, he added. But the Government regulates the inflow of foreign workers into Singapore via the final entry approvals, which are decided based on several factors such as restrictions decided by the Government’s COVID-19 task force and the availability of stay-home notice facilities.

“Because of that, you’ll find that the IPA approvals will far exceed the number of entry approvals coming into Singapore,” he said.

With the extension of the IPAs, the “backlog of cases … has increased significantly”, Dr Tan added.

“As a result, even if you allow for an automatic extension of the approval process, it doesn't make sense because the extension is going to go months ahead without any certainty as to whether ultimately we can grant the entry approvals,” he told the House.

“I think that's where the challenge is today because we have no way of telling whether … many of these source countries where we get our workers from can actually provide certainty of a control of the outbreak.”

“The extension of the validity of these IPAs … is something that we are now reviewing,” Dr Tan said, adding that authorities are also looking at the possibility of reimbursements of application fees.

"Poor housekeeping practices, lapses in cleaning could have led to gastroenteritis outbreaks in schools: Grace Fu","Poor housekeeping practices in schools and lapses in cleaning could have caused recent incidents of gastroenteritis outbreaks at education institutions, said Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu in Parliament on Tuesday (May 11).

Ms Fu was responding to a question from Member of Parliament Hany Soh (PAP-Marsiling-Yew Tee), who had asked for the findings from investigations conducted into these incidents as well as what action have been taken to manage such incidents and prevent them from recurring.

AdvertisementAdvertisement
For the recent incidents at education institutions, investigations suggest that poor housekeeping practices in schools and lapses in cleaning including within schools’ in-house kitchens could have contributed to the (gastroenteritis) outbreaks, said Fu.

Since the start of 2021, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) have conducted joint investigations into 27 incidents of gastroenteritis outbreaks involving more than 800 people, said Ms Fu.

Of these incidents, 18 were associated with education institutions, with 13 in pre-schools alone. 

AdvertisementAdvertisement
Despite only being four months into the year, this is reaching the level of 2019, when 18 out of 33 gastroenteritis incidents in education institutions occurred in pre-schools,  Ms Fu said.

For one, she noted that ineffective cleaning agents such as all-purpose cleaners were used to sanitise areas contaminated with vomit and faeces. 

The use of all-purpose cleaners instead of disinfectants such as diluted household bleach will not be able to effectively clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces, Ms Fu added.

Chopping boards and knives for raw meat and cooked food were also found kept together instead of separately, thus increasing the risk for cross-contamination.

Government agencies including MOH, the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Early Childhood Development Agency and SFA, are working closely to adopt a multi-pronged approach to reduce such incidents in education institutions, said Ms Fu.

We are particularly concerned about pre-schools, given that young children are more vulnerable, she said.

Measures that are put into place include issuing schools with guidelines and advisories on environmental hygiene and good food safety practices, health screening of staff and students, and briefings on good cleaning practices, personal hygiene and food safety practices for teachers, food handlers and cleaners, said Ms Fu.

In addition, the ministry will also implement the environmental sanitation regime for premises such as pre-schools under the Environmental Public Health Act later this year, as previously announced.

It is a collective effort to combat (gastroenteritis) outbreaks in our education institutions. Education institutions must play their part to keep their students safe by up-keeping high standards of environmental and personal hygiene, and food safety at all times, said Ms Fu.

Parents and caregivers should also keep their sick children at home until they recover, so as to facilitate a healthy and safe environment for all students."
Gan Kim Yong to remain as co-chair of COVID-19 task force,"Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong will continue to co-chair the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force after he moves to the Ministry of Trade and Industry on May 15. 

Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung will take over the Ministry of Health (MOH) portfolio. Mr Gan will remain as co-chair of the task force together with Mr Ong and Minister for Education Lawrence Wong.

Following the recent Cabinet reshuffle, Mr Wong will take over as Minister for Finance, with Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat stepping down from the post. 

Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaran will replace Mr Ong as Transport Minister, and Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing will replace Mr Wong as Education Minister.

“I’ll be handing over the Ministry of Health to minister Ong Ye Kung shortly. But I’ll continue to co-chair the multi-ministry task force together with minister Lawrence Wong and minister Ong,” Mr Gan said in Parliament on Tuesday (May 11).

“I would like to take this opportunity to thank members of the task force for their support which has allowed us to mount a whole-of-government response to the pandemic. 

Mr Gan has been the Health Minister for almost a decade. 

Responding to his ministerial statement, Member of Parliament Sylvia Lim (WP-Aljunied) said: “I, too, feel nostalgic that this may be the last time that I have a chance to pose health-related questions to him after the last 10 years. So the feeling is mutual in that sense.”

At a press conference on May 4, Mr Gan said he had discussed with Mr Ong and Mr Wong about how the team can ensure continuity for the task force. 

“The three of us will continue to be involved in the (task force) and we will continue to share and support one another as we go ahead,” he added.

"Former SingPost senior vice-president charged with seeking S$1m bribe, cheating company of S$15,000 salary","A former senior vice-president at Singapore Post was charged in court on Tuesday (May 11) with cheating the company into giving him a monthly salary of S$15,000 for more than four years with fake job application documents.

Liang An Wey, 46, is also accused of attempting to seek a bribe of S$1 million from the chief operating officer of a subcontractor for construction works for SingPost.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
Liang was given a charge each of corruptly obtaining to gain gratification and of cheating SingPost.

According to charge sheets, Liang submitted false information about his past employment and salary when applying for a job at SingPost. He claimed that he had been employed by GSM Holdings between 2012 and June 2013 for a salary of S$14,500.

SingPost was deceived into delivering a monthly salary of S$15,000 to Liang for four years and eight months, or a total of S$840,000.

Liang was also accused of trying to get a bribe from the chief operating officer of Bintai Kindenko in March 2015. He allegedly asked for the bribe in return for recommending Bintai as a preferred subcontractor for certain works in the construction of SingPost Centre Retail Mall Redevelopment and the SingPost Office Asset Enhancement Initiative.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
In response to queries from CNA, a spokesperson for SingPost said the company was alerted to Liang's activities by the relevant authorities in 2017 and gave its full assistance in investigations. 

SingPost had also conducted its own internal inquiry, and dismissed him in April 2018, he said.

Liang will return to court in June. If convicted of corruption, he can be jailed up to five years, fined up to S$100,000, or both. He could be jailed up to 10 years and fined if convicted of cheating."
1.8 million people in Singapore have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine,"As of May 9, about 1.8 million people have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, with 1.2 million of them receiving their second dose, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong in Parliament on Tuesday (May 11).

In a ministerial statement on the whole-of-government response to COVID-19, Mr Gan noted that Singapore continues to make steady progress with its vaccination programme and that the take-up has been encouraging.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
He pointed out that about two-thirds of eligible people aged 45 and above have received the COVID-19 vaccination or booked their vaccination appointments. 

However, we need to continue to encourage more to be vaccinated - especially among the seniors - as given their age, they are the most vulnerable. I urge all of us to encourage our elderly family members too, said Mr Gan, who is also co-chair of the multi-ministry task force on COVID-19.

We will be inviting subsequent age bands to receive vaccinations from the later part of May. However, as vaccine supplies continue to be limited, vaccinations will be progressively extended in smaller age-bands. We thank everyone for your patience. And if vaccine supplies arrive as scheduled, we will complete the vaccination programme by the end of this year.

BENEFITS OUTWEIGHING RISKS

Mr Gan also noted that the benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines continue to outweigh the known risks and that there remains a need to encourage Singaporeans to be vaccinated.

As of Monday, 30 local fully vaccinated cases tested positive for COVID-19, noted Mr Gan. There were another 24 imported cases that were already vaccinated.
Advertisement
Most of our local cases of infected vaccinated individuals were asymptomatic. None had severe COVID-19 disease requiring more intensive care, said Mr Gan.

This is consistent with the international experience and emerging evidence that vaccines are highly efficacious in protecting against severe COVID-19 disease and likely to reduce the risk of transmission.

When it comes to re-infected cases, as of Monday, 26 cases have been assessed to be re-infections, revealed Mr Gan.

We are still investigating whether these are due to general waning of immunity over time or the lack of cross-protection against specific variants of COVID-19 that the individual is naive to. We will provide an update when we know more, he said.

Mr Gan also responded to questions from Members of Parliament on vaccinations for children below 16; those with mild allergic reactions; and the need for a third booster shot. 

He noted that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are currently only approved for use in people aged 16 and 18 years old and above respectively. 

“Initial data provided by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna at the time of the pandemic special access route (PSAR) interim authorisation did not include data regarding their use in younger populations,” he said.

“The Health Sciences Authority has been examining the supplemental data that have since been submitted for the Pfizer vaccine, to assess if the vaccine meets safety and efficacy requirements for authorisation under PSAR for use in adolescents aged 12 to 15 years. HSA will also do so for (the) Moderna vaccine when data is submitted to them. We will share more details when ready.”

Mr Gan noted that those assessed by a doctor to be allergic to the first dose of COVID-19 vaccination are currently “contraindicated” from the vaccine and should not continue with the second dose.

When it comes to booster shots, Mr Gan said data on the need for it is still emerging, from both international and local studies. 

He said: “We will share more when we know more. Meanwhile, get the first two shots first.”

As of May 3, 104 applications for the vaccine injury financial assistance programme have been received, said Mr Gan. Thirty of them have been assessed to meet the qualifying criteria, he added.

This includes 21 cases of hypersensitivity, or allergic reactions, four neurology-related cases, three cardiology-related cases, and one haematology and dermatology-related case each.

All of these cases have since been discharged from hospital, and the remaining 29 applications are pending, said the Health Minister. 

TACKLING 'FEARMONGERING'

Mr Gan also responded to questions about whether Singapore will recognise overseas vaccinations that are not approved by HSA. 

Singapore is in discussion with several regions on mutual recognition of vaccination certificates for travel purposes, he said, reiterating Minister for Transport Ong Ye Kung. Details will be released when the arrangements are confirmed, Mr Gan added. 

Responding to questions about Sinovac and other vaccine candidates, Mr Gan said that Singapore had entered into advance purchase agreements with Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Sinovac last year, even before the clinical trials were completed. 

This was to “secure a diversified vaccine portfolio to improve our chances” of securing a suitable vaccine that is safe and effective for the population, he added. 

“This was how we managed to start our vaccination drive with Pfizer and Moderna vaccines early.” 

Singapore took the delivery of a shipment of the Sinovac vaccines based on the schedules that had been planned for and committed under the advance purchase agreement with the company, said Mr Gan.

“HSA is currently carefully evaluating Sinovac and a few other vaccines for use in Singapore, and we will update the public when we have made progress,” he added

Mr Gan noted that there has also been “vaccine misinformation”, and said that the Government aims to curb its spread.

Responding to a question from the Leader of Opposition Pritam Singh, who had asked how the Government will address this, Mr Gan said that public education remains a “cornerstone” of the vaccination programme. 

“Government agencies have been using multiple platforms including print and broadcast media, social media, direct messaging platforms, and Gov.sg to communicate essential information about the COVID-19, including its vaccines to all segments of society,” he added.

He noted that when called for, the Government would not hesitate to use “legislative levers” such as POFMA Correction Directions to stop individuals from spreading misinformation and “fear-mongering”.

Said Mr Gan: “All of us have a role to play in stemming the spread of misinformation. Once again, I urge everyone to check that the information they receive comes from reliable sources and to make the effort to verify before sharing them.”

Support measures more than offset GST payable by bottom 20% of households: Lawrence Wong,"The support given to households in the bottom 20 per cent by income exceeded the Goods and Services Tax (GST) payable by them in 2019 and 2020, said Second Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong on Tuesday (May 11).

He was responding in Parliament to MP Louis Chua (WP-Sengkang), who asked for the percentage of GST paid by these households that is offset by GST vouchers. Mr Chua also asked for the percentage based on one-off versus permanent GST voucher schemes.

From 2018 to 2020, the permanent GST voucher scheme helped to offset an average of 84 per cent of annual GST payable by the bottom 20 per cent of Singaporean households on a per household member basis, said Mr Wong.

The average percentage goes up to 117 per cent for the last two years with special payments under the scheme.

“In other words … households in the bottom 20 per cent got more from both the permanent and one-off GST vouchers than the amount of GST payable,” the minister said.

The GST voucher initiative, first introduced in Budget 2012, comprises an annual cash payout for lower-income Singaporeans, a yearly Medisave top-up for those aged 65 and above and quarterly utility bill rebates (U-Save) for lower- and middle-income HDB households.

There were additional one-off GST Voucher special payments over the past three years, such as the special cash payment given out to Singaporeans in 2019 to celebrate the country’s bicentennial year.

An additional S$20 of U-Save rebates was also given annually from 2019 to 2021 to mitigate the impact of the introduction of the carbon tax.

Further U-Save rebates were given to eligible HDB households last year amid the economic fallout during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Mr Wong said the Government is “very focused” on the issue of inequality and has been tackling this through a whole range of measures, including the GST Voucher scheme and Workfare.

He referred to the drop in Singapore's Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, as an indication that current government schemes are working.

“We will continue to do more to address inequality and social mobility, particularly given the concerns of COVID-19 and the impact of the pandemic being felt disproportionately more by the lower-income groups,” he said.

The Government continues to study enhancements to the permanent GST Voucher scheme.

“An enhanced GSTV scheme will continue to be part of the progressive system of taxes and transfers that we have in Singapore, ensuring that lower-income households receive more benefits than the taxes that they pay,” he said."
BTO projects expected 'to be delayed' by a year or more due to tightened COVID-19 border measures,"Many Build-to-Order (BTO) housing projects are expected to be delayed by a year or more, as a result of tighter border measures affecting the construction sector, said Education Minister Lawrence Wong in Parliament on Tuesday (May 11).

These tightened measures include longer Stay-Home Notice periods for all travellers from higher-risk places, and a ban on short-term visitors and long-term pass holders with recent travel history from India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

Delivering a ministerial statement on the Government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr Wong acknowledged that many have called for even stricter rules to prevent infections from entering the country – but he said these moves have serious impacts on Singapore and Singaporeans.

In particular, contractors will be hit “especially hard”, and private home buyers may also face delays of varying lengths, said Mr Wong, who is also the co-chair of the multi-ministry task force dealing with COVID-19.

“Likewise companies in the marine and process sectors will be badly affected. They will find it hard to deliver their existing projects on time, and a few may even have to forgo new opportunities and projects.

“These are important sectors that we have taken decades to build – they hire thousands of Singaporean engineers and executives, and remain crucial sources of highly-skilled jobs,” Mr Wong said.

CASCADING EFFECT

The manpower crunch will have a “cascading effect” on the entire economy, he added, noting that any company seeking to bring in any workers from higher-risk countries face considerable delays – as the waiting time for an entry approval could stretch beyond six months.

“Our big concern is that if companies continue to face difficulties or are forced to close, we could then end up with higher unemployment and job losses for Singaporeans,” he said.

From a societal point of view, Mr Wong said the stricter border measures mean Singaporeans would find it harder to reunite with their families abroad, while those looking for new foreign domestic workers (FDWs) would have to wait for at least two months.

“These are the consequences of keeping our borders tight, and I hope Members will help to explain this to your constituents when you receive appeals,” he said.

CONTROL OF BORDER MEASURES IS “DYNAMIC PROCESS”

Mr Wong also said that the control over the flow of travellers into Singapore is a “dynamic process”, based on assessments of each country’s public health situation.

He noted that before the pandemic, about 200,000 travellers went through Changi Airport each day. By November last year, this had plummeted to 820 arrivals a day.

Between December and March this year, there were about 1,200 arrivals each day.

The reason for this increase: Singapore was taking in more FDWs and migrant workers in the construction, marine and process (CMP) sector, he said.

But even so, Mr Wong said the inflow of CMP workers allowed up to now is still unable to meet Singapore’s needs.

“Because every day, every week, every month, many migrant workers have left to go back to their home countries. Whatever numbers we are bringing in barely replace those who have left.

In the meantime, authorities will do more to assist the CMP sector which is bearing the brunt of the impact, he said. For instance, firms in this sector will receive higher foreign worker levy rebates from May to December this year.

Beyond this sector and aviation and tourism-related segments, Mr Wong said there are signs of improvement in the broader economy.

Barring any setbacks and provided that Singapore can keep the COVID-19 situation under control, the country should be able to continue its recovery trajectory, he said.

But he cautioned that the outlook remains uncertain. In the meantime, authorities will monitor the situation closely, and consider how best to support those who need help to adjust, he said.

At the same time, he said businesses need to be more agile and start “factoring the need to pivot plans or operating models at short notice.

"Healthcare workers being asked to move out, shunned in public a ‘very worrisome trend’: Gan Kim Yong","Cases of Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) employees being shunned in public or asked to move out of homes is “a very worrisome trend”, said Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong on Tuesday (May 11). 

The hospital is an active COVID-19 cluster, with 43 coronavirus cases linked to it. 
AdvertisementAdvertisement
“This is a very worrisome trend ... we observed some minority of resident Singaporeans taking steps to protect themselves at the expense of our healthcare workers' well-being. Some of them have been asked to move out of their homes by their landlords, some of their co-workers are shunning them. I think these are wrong,” said Mr Gan in Parliament.

“We are struggling because on one hand, we know this is wrong, we should not condone such actions. On the other hand, we are concerned about the well-being of the healthcare workers and do need to find ways to help them and support them.” 

The Health Minister was responding to a clarification from Member of Parliament Tan Wu Meng (PAP-Jurong) about what is being done to help affected TTSH workers.

Dr Tan cited several cases of nurses who have been told by their landlords to move out at short notice, as well as a father who works at TTSH who has had to move out of the house to keep his wife and her fellow healthcare workers at another hospital safe from COVID-19 transmission between hospitals. 

“What is being done to help affected TTSH workers, nurses who can't find a place to stay, healthcare workers who can't find a Grab or taxi to bring them to the hospital or to take them home after a shift, families who have been separated by necessary COVID-19 precautions who need help with childcare, help with getting the kids to continue in school?” he asked. 

He also suggested that the Ministry of Health (MOH) set up a team to connect government agencies to provide help to affected TTSH healthcare workers, especially for “challenges that may beyond the reach of individual hospital management”.

MOH and the multi-ministry task force are working with TTSH and other hospitals to provide support for the affected workers, said Mr Gan. He added that the team has started negotiations with hotels and other places to provide alternative accommodation to affected healthcare workers.

“Let me say that this should not be an excuse to the landlords to kick them out on the basis, since now there's an alternative accommodation, why not just move over to the hotels rather than staying on in the flat, he said.

“I think it is still our preference to encourage our landlords to understand the situation, to play their part to support our healthcare workers, and the work that we do. And I also want Singaporeans to also show their support to these healthcare workers, because they are putting themselves in harm's way in order to protect us. So let us work together to protect them.” 

In his ministerial statement earlier, Mr Gan acknowledged reports of healthcare workers from TTSH being shunned in public or refused services after the cluster at the hospital emerged. 

“I know this comes from a small minority of Singaporeans. The great majority is thankful for the sacrifices and contributions of our healthcare workers, including from Tan Tock Seng Hospital, he said.

Thanking healthcare workers for their contributions, Mr Gan added: “We know you have been working tirelessly in difficult and uncertain conditions. Despite the stressful situation caused by the outbreak, you continue to do your best for the patients. 

“I believe I speak for the great majority of Singaporeans, all of us in the Ministry of Health, and everyone in this Chamber, that we are all solidly behind you.”

New artefacts from prisoners of war on display at revamped Changi Chapel and Museum,"In a letter dated Apr 20, 1945, a woman named Florence Duncan professed her steadfast love for her husband, John Sharp Duncan, after he was captured when Singapore fell to the Japanese.

They had only been married for a year, but she wrote that it was another birthday since their separation and she missed him.

Mrs Duncan’s poignant letter is one of the 114 personal effects and war artefacts on display at the Changi Chapel and Museum, which spotlight the hardships, courage and resilience of prisoners of war (POWs) and their families during the Japanese Occupation in Singapore. 

On May 19, the National Heritage Board will unveil the revamped Changi Chapel and Museum, comprising contributions from the descendants of POWs and civilian internees at the Changi prison camp. 

The refurbished space will have 82 personal objects on display for the first time, among which is a Kodak Baby Brownie camera. It was given to Sergeant John Ritchie Johnston by his wife. He managed to keep it hidden from his captors during his time in prison.

There are also new multimedia offerings, such as historical recordings of conversations between the internees in a recreated Changi Gaol prison cell, taking visitors on an immersive journey across eight exhibition zones.

Visitors familiar with the previous Changi Chapel and Museum will recognise familiar artefacts, like a Morse code transmitting device disguised as a matchbox.

CURATING AUTHENTIC EXPERIENCES 

The guiding principle in curating the exhibition was authenticity, curators Rachel Eng and Iskander Mydin told CNA.

The main challenge, they said, was ensuring donated items were presented in a “thoughtfully curated narrative”, accurately and meaningfully depicting the POW or civilian internee’s personal stories of life in the prison camp.

“The personal artefacts of POWs and civilian internees should speak for themselves without going through someone else’s interpretation or layering,” they added.

“We spoke to many families to obtain personal stories and artefacts, and consulted the numerous diaries, records and oral histories left behind by the internees, largely allowing their voices to take centre stage.”

Besides reflecting the hardships endured by POWs and internees, some personal artefacts also show their resourcefulness amid struggle. 

One such item is a bamboo toothbrush donated by the family of Forbes Wallace, a volunteer with the Territorial Army.

“The toothbrush itself looks inconspicuous but was actually made in Changi camp. Due to a shortage of supplies, prisoners ingeniously set up factories to manufacture all sorts of items, from soap to rubber soles and artificial limbs,” said Ms Eng, who counts the toothbrush as one of her favourite artefacts.

“The Changi Broom Factory produced brooms, shaving brushes, spiral brushes for the repair of typewriters and toothbrushes such as the one that belonged to Wallace.”

The bristles of the toothbrush are made from coconut fibre and the handle from bamboo.

“Given the lack of materials that the prisoners faced, their inventiveness was quite amazing to me,” she added.

While putting together the exhibition, both curators added that they were struck by how much interest there was in Changi, and how committed many families were to finding out more about their relatives’ lives in the prison camp.

They cited writer Louise Reynolds, who published two books about her father Eric Cordingly’s POW experiences, and many others who were writing manuscripts and conducting research about their family members.

At the new Changi Chapel and Museum, visitors who have personal memories of internees can even contribute to a living database of more than 50,000 POWs and civilian internees, in order to preserve their legacies. 

In light of tightened COVID-19 measures, interested visitors are encouraged to pre-book their admission tickets at www.changichapelmuseum.gov.sg from noon on May 17. "
"Former BP director jailed, ordered to pay more than S$6 million for taking bribes","A former director of BP Singapore was jailed for 54 months and ordered to pay a penalty of about S$6.22 million on Tuesday (May 11) for taking bribes.

Clarence Chang Peng Hong had suggested that Koh Seng Lee set up Pacific Prime Trading, a petroleum and petroleum products wholesaler, to be a trading counterpart of BP.
AdvertisementAdvertisement
This was on the understanding that Chang would advance the business interest of (Pacific Prime Trading) with BP and would therefore be entitled to payments in return, said the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) in a press release.

Between July 2006 and July 2010, Koh, the executive director of Pacific Prime Trading, gave US$3.95 million (S$5.2 million) to Chang pursuant to their agreement.

Koh also agreed to give Chang S$500,000 as a form of investment into an education business franchise that Chang's wife was involved in.

Chang and Koh were convicted of corruption in July last year. On Monday, Koh was also sentenced to 54 months' imprisonment.

Chang, who was BP's former eastern regional director for marine fuels, separately faces money laundering charges.

He allegedly transferred almost S$4.7 million worth of corrupt proceeds from an HSBC bank account in Hong Kong to a POSB account and two other HSBC accounts in Singapore.

Chang is suspected of converting nearly S$4 million to buy three private landed properties and two condominium apartments. That amount was wholly or partially the direct or indirect benefits of corrupt proceeds, said CPIB.

He was also charged with converting S$111,000 worth of corrupt proceeds to acquire share capital in a pre-school.

The money laundering charges were stood down for the purpose of the corruption trial and will be dealt with subsequently, said CPIB.

Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence in Singapore can be jailed for up to five years, fined up to S$100,000 or both.

Anyone guilty of accepting gratification can also be ordered to pay a penalty equal to the amount of that gratification.

Those convicted of a money laundering offence can be jailed for up to seven years, fined up to S$500,000 or both.

To avoid falling victim to dishonest practices by rogue employees seeking personal gains, companies are strongly advised to put in place robust procedures in areas such as procurement and internal audit, said CPIB.

Companies can refer to CPIB's guidance on measures to prevent corruption, and are strongly encouraged to obtain certification on anti-bribery management systems, said the bureau."
"‘Several important lessons’ from Tan Tock Seng Hospital COVID-19 cluster, says Gan Kim Yong","Singapore has learnt several important lessons from the COVID-19 cluster at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), among them - that the B16172 strain “appears very infectious” and vaccines are “not a guarantee” against infection, said Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong on Tuesday (May 11). 

The B16172 variant of the coronavirus was first detected in India. 
AdvertisementAdvertisement
Singapore authorities said earlier this month that five cases in the TTSH cluster have the B16172 variant.

Giving an update on the TTSH cluster and the lessons learnt, Mr Gan said in a ministerial statement in Parliament: This particular B16172 strain appears very infectious, and there will be other variants just like it.

“While vaccine breakthroughs are possible, vaccines can help to prevent severe illnesses. Vaccines can also reduce risk of further transmission, although the extent of which this is true is still being investigated.

He added: “It is clear that vaccination is most effective when it is part of a whole suite of precautionary measures, such as mask wearing, safe-distancing, accurate testing, thorough contact tracing and timely isolation.”

CONTAINMENT MEASURES

The first case detected in the TTSH cluster was a nurse who worked in Ward 9D. She developed symptoms of acute respiratory infection on Apr 28 and tested positive for COVID-19 on the same day.

“She dutifully reported her symptoms and she was immediately tested. And despite the fact that she had completed her vaccination earlier in the year, she was confirmed to be COVID-positive,” Mr Gan said. 

“I should point out that this does not mean that she is the first infected case, and had brought COVID-19 into the wards. Investigation is still ongoing. But her responsible act enabled us to pick up the cluster at Tan Tock Seng Hospital.”

The COVID-19 task force “immediately threw a containment ring” around the first detected case, quarantining close contacts and testing everyone who could have been in contact with her, said the Health Minister.

He added that the immediate priority in such situations is to contain and isolate the infections so that they do not spread to the larger community. 

“This included all staff and patients of the affected Ward 9D. By the next day on Apr 29, we had identified three staff and six patients of Ward 9D who were infected,” said Mr Gan. 

One of these patients started to display symptoms. As he had entered Ward 9D earlier on Apr 20, Mr Gan noted that testing and quarantine were extended to all staff members who worked in Ward 9D, as well as discharged and current inpatients and visitors to the ward from Apr 20. 

All inpatients and employees working in the main ward block were also tested for COVID-19, added Mr Gan.

After this round of testing, all other hospital staff were also screened, and patients and staff from the main ward block were tested for infection again for “additional precaution”. 

“We then threw a larger ring around Tan Tock Seng Hospital, inviting discharged patients and visitors who were in the hospital during the affected period to also be tested. They are not close contacts and hence have a lower risk of infection, but we offer to test them for abundance of caution and to give them peace of mind,” said Mr Gan. 

“For every case detected, a large ring was drawn around them for testing and isolation, and we locked down all wards that had exposure to infectious cases.” 

As of May 10, close to 2,500 people have been quarantined. A total of 12,500 people have been tested as part of the special testing operations, said Mr Gan. 

This is on top of 12,000 staff members, 1,000 patients, as well as those under quarantine. 

There are a total of 43 COVID-19 cases in the hospital cluster - 10 staff members, 26 patients and seven visitors or household members, he added. 

“We will continue to monitor the individuals who have been exposed, and retest them where necessary as some of them may be incubating the infection.”

VACCINATION PROVIDES CRITICAL PROTECTION

Of the 43 cases in the cluster, seven staff members and two patients had received full doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, said the Health Minister. “They were all either asymptomatic, or only exhibited mild symptoms, and none of them required oxygen support.” 

Among the 34 who were not fully vaccinated, six needed oxygen support, two are in intensive care, and one died from COVID-19 complications, he added. 

“While the numbers are too small to draw firm conclusions, the findings do indicate that vaccination provides critical protection even against COVID-19 variants,” said Mr Gan. 

“We know that while vaccination does not eliminate the risks of infection completely, it does provide significant protection against infection and help to reduce the severity of the disease. It is also likely to reduce onward transmission.

“I therefore urge everyone to get vaccinated when it is offered to you, and continue to comply with safe management measures even if you have been vaccinated. This will help to keep all of us safe.” 

To prevent further spread of COVID-19 in the hospital, TTSH has locked down affected wards, stopped all new admissions to the hospital, restricted visitors and reinforced infection control, hand hygiene and PPE compliance for all staff, noted Mr Gan. 

“Even while we were dealing with the cluster, work was also ongoing to understand the source and course of the infection. Investigation is still ongoing and more will be shared when it is ready.”

Inland ash scattering garden at Choa Chu Kang Cemetery opens next week,"Those looking for a final resting place for their loved ones will have a new option from next Monday (May 17) - an inland ash scattering garden at Choa Chu Kang Cemetery Complex. 

The Garden of Peace @ CCK was designed as a peaceful, serene and respectful environment for ash scattering, said the National Environment Agency (NEA) on Tuesday in a press release. 
AdvertisementAdvertisement
The 9,500 sq m garden is a secular facility open to all faiths. It was developed after talks with religious groups, the funerary industry and other stakeholders in February, said the agency. 

Those interested will have to apply on NEA's website and pay a fee of S$320 for the scattering of ashes. 

The garden is open from 9am to 5pm daily and each family will have two hours to complete their ash scattering and rites. 

Under current COVID-19 restrictions, those who make bookings can come in groups of up to five. This excludes funeral directors and religious workers. The garden is also open to the public. 
AdvertisementAdvertisement
After collecting the ashes of their loved ones at the Choa Chu Kang or Mandai crematoriums, families can proceed to scatter the ashes in the garden. Only fine human ashes should be scattered in the garden, and crematoriums will provide services to pulverise cremated remains into powder fine ashes. 

A container with small, pre-cut holes at the top will be provided to family members, who can also choose to use their own container. After the ash scattering, families can choose to dispose of the provided containers, which are made of cardboard, in the allocated bin.

The garden is quiet and surrounded by greenery, with a small pavilion to provide shade. There are four ash scattering lanes, each named after a flower, with some seating areas lush with creeper plants, trees and bushes. 

Ash scattering lanes are separated and are designed for privacy for families, said NEA. The lanes are also designed to allow ashes to “naturally percolate into the soil underneath”. 

After scattering the ashes, families can use watering cans and taps provided to water the area where the ash was scattered, to ensure the ashes sink into the soil below. At the end of the day when the garden is closed, sprinklers will also wash ashes into the soil. 

Wheelchair access and seating areas are provided for loved ones to observe and participate in the ash scattering process, said the agency. 

Religious ceremonies or rites like the burning of joss sticks, playing of instruments or music, or food offerings will not be permitted in the garden to “maintain a clean and serene environment and the secular nature of the garden”, said NEA. 

Visitors can use a prayer facility to conduct simple rites. It comprises a simple table that faces the garden and some seating areas. 

“We hope that Singaporeans will welcome the provision of inland ash scattering services as an additional option for the management of cremated human remains,” said deputy CEO of NEA and director-general of public health Chew Ming Fai. 

During consultations with religious groups and other stakeholders, the consensus was the facility should be secular and the experience respectful and dignified, he said.

“There was an emphasis that the facility should adopt a serene garden feel, where family and friends would be accorded privacy during the act of ash scattering,” Mr Chew added.

Inland ash scattering services will also be introduced at the new Mandai Crematorium Complex. The Garden of Serenity there will be completed with the new crematorium, and is expected to be operational in 2022, said NEA. "

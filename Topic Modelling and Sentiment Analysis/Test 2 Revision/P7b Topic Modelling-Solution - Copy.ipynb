    "## Topic Modelling\n",
    "With the vast amount of unstructured text data, it is essential to find a method to organise the data in to meaningful groups or topics for actionable insights. Topic modelling is a technique to extract the hidden topics from the unstructured text. One of the popular topic modelling algorithm is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). With many implementations available in the internet, the challenge is not about implementing a topic model but how to extract good quality of topics. This depends on the quality of text preprocessing and the strategy of finding the optimal number of topics.,\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical, we will be looking at how we can use Python gensim and nltk packages to implement a LDA topic model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can use the various packages in Python, we need to make sure the relevant packages are installed and imported. \n",

Ocean's 12 fell to number two while new entry Spanglish entered the chart at number three, taking $9m (Â£4.6m). A Series of Unfortunate Events also stars Scottish comedian Billy Connelly, while Carrey takes on a number of different roles in the surreal film. The only other new entry in the top 10 was re-make, Flight of the Phoenix, at number eight, starring Dennis Quaid. Carrey entertained crowds at the UK premiere of Lemony Snicket in London on Friday. The actor grabbed co-star Meryl Streep and whisked her around Leicester Square. Based on the cult children's books by author Daniel Handler, the film follows three children who are orphaned when their parents die in a fire. They are taken in by their wicked uncle Count Olaf, played by Carrey, who schemes to get his hands on their fortune.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Ocean\\'s Twelve raids box office\\n\\nOcean\\'s Twelve, the crime caper sequel starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts, has gone straight to number one in the US box office chart.\\n\\nIt took $40.8m (Â£21m) in weekend ticket sales, according to studio estimates. The sequel follows the master criminals as they try to pull off three major heists across Europe. It knocked last week\\'s number one, National Treasure, into third place. Wesley Snipes\\' Blade: Trinity was in second, taking $16.1m (Â£8.4m). Rounding out the top five was animated fable The Polar Express, starring Tom Hanks, and festive comedy Christmas with the Kranks.\\n\\nOcean\\'s Twelve box office triumph marks the fourth-biggest opening for a December release in the US, after the three films in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The sequel narrowly beat its 2001 predecessor, Ocean\\'s Eleven which took $38.1m (Â£19.8m) on its opening weekend and $184m (Â£95.8m) in total. A remake of the 1960s film, starring Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack, Ocean\\'s Eleven was directed by Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh. Soderbergh returns to direct the hit sequel which reunites Clooney, Pitt and Roberts with Matt Damon, Andy Garcia and Elliott Gould. Catherine Zeta-Jones joins the all-star cast. \"It\\'s just a fun, good holiday movie,\" said Dan Fellman, president of distribution at Warner Bros. However, US critics were less complimentary about the $110m (Â£57.2m) project, with the Los Angeles Times labelling it a \"dispiriting vanity project\". A milder review in the New York Times dubbed the sequel \"unabashedly trivial\".\\n',\n",
       " 'Parmalat to return to stockmarket\\n\\nParmalat, the Italian dairy company which went bust after an accounting scandal, hopes to be back on the Italian stock exchange in July.\\n\\nThe firm gained protection from creditors in 2003 after revealing debts of 14bn euros ($18.34bn; Â£9.6bn). This was eight times higher than it had previously stated. In a statement issued on Wednesday night, Parmalat Finanziaria detailed administrators\\' latest plans for re-listing the shares of the group.\\n\\nAs part of the re-listing on the Italian stock exchange, creditors\\' debts are expected to be converted into shares through two new share issues amounting to more than 2bn euros. The company\\'s creditors will be asked to vote on the plan later this year. The plan is likely to give creditors of Parmalat Finanziaria shares worth about 5.7% of the debts they are owed. This is lower than the 11.3% creditors previously hoped to receive. Creditors of Parmalat, the main operating company, are likely to see the percentage of debt they receive fall from 7.3% to 6.9%.\\n\\nSeveral former top Parmalat executives are under investigation for the fraud scandal. Lawmakers said on Wednesday night Enrico Bondi, the turnaround specialist appointed by the Italian government as Parmalat\\'s chief executive, spoke positively about the company during a closed-door hearing of the Chamber of Deputies industry commission. \"Bondi supplied us with elements of positive results on the industrial positions and on the history of debt which will find a point of solution through the Parmalat group\\'s quotation on the market in July,\" Italian news agency Apcom quoted several lawmakers as saying in a statement.\\n',\n",

But Green MSP Mark Ballard fears people not on the council\\'s edited electoral register may miss out. Local authorities can only send ballot papers to those on the edited list over non-statutory matters, such as the transport referendum. Therefore, residents who have exercised their right to have their details left off the list could miss the chance to vote.\\n\\nHowever, there is still time for those who are not on the list to contact the council and make sure they are sent ballot forms ahead of February\\'s voting deadline. Mr Ballard said: \"This vote will set the future of transport in Edinburgh for decades to come. \"It is therefore vital that as many residents as possible in Edinburgh City and the surrounding areas, are registered to vote in the ballot. \"Many people are not aware that they may miss out on their chance to have a say. \"Everyone involved in this debate - both for and against - wants the ballot to be as fair and representative as possible, and that means encouraging people to take part.\" The ballot will ask residents to vote for or against the council\\'s proposed congestion charge scheme and a host of transport improvements to be funded by it. The outcome of the referendum will be known next month after the ballot forms are sent out and returned to the council. Towards the end of February, the council will meet to decide whether to proceed with an application to Scottish ministers for approval for its planned congestion charging scheme and the other parts of its transport package.\\n',\n",
       " 'Fockers retain film chart crown\\n\\nComedy Meet The Fockers has held on to the number one spot at the North American box office for a second week.\\n\\nIt took $42.8m (Â£23.7m) at the weekend, making its overall takings more than $163m (Â£90m) in 12 days, according to studio estimates. It took $19.1m (Â£9.9m) on Christmas Day alone, the highest takings on that day in box office history. The sequel to the Ben Stiller comedy Meet The Parents stars Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. The success of Meet the Fockers could help produce record box office revenue for 2004, said Paul Dergarabedian, president of the industry\\'s tracker Exhibitor Relations. \"We\\'ve had a much stronger than anticipated final week of the year that helped the industry end on a high note,\" said Mr Dergarabedian.\\n\\nMeet the Fockers also broke the box office records for the most money taken on New Year\\'s Eve, when it made $12.2m (Â£6.2m), and New Year\\'s Day, when it took $18m (Â£9.4m). The previous New Year\\'s Eve record was set in 2000 by Cast Away with $8.5m (Â£4.5m). The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King had held the New Year\\'s Day title with $12.8m (Â£6.7m). However, Christmas takings were down 26.5% on 2003\\'s figures - which was blamed on Christmas falling over a weekend this year. This weekend\\'s top 12 films took an estimated $125.4m (Â£65.8m), a 4.3% increase on the same weekend last year. But there were no major releases last week to provide competition to Meet the Fockers or Lemony Snicket\\'s A Series of Unfortunate Events, which finished in second place with $14.7m (Â£7.7m). The Aviator, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes, ended up in third position after taking $11.2m (Â£5.9m). Comedy Fat Albert - co-written by Bill Cosby - moved down the chart to fourth place after taking $10.7m (Â£5.6m).\\n',\n",
       " 'Brown shrugs off economy fears\\n\\nGordon Brown is to freeze petrol duty increases, fund a Â£1bn package to avoid big council tax rises and boost childcare and maternity leave.\\n\\nIn an upbeat pre-Budget report, he slightly increased borrowing but insisted economic targets would be met. The chancellor also hailed the longest period of growth in UK \"industrial history\" but denied he was \"gloating\". But Oliver Letwin, for the Tories, attacked government red tape and debt, dubbing Mr Brown \"Sir Wastealot\".\\n\\nThe shadow chancellor said Mr Brown\\'s \"golden rule\" had \"turned to dross in his hands\" and said he was borrowing to spend, not invest, with predicted debt over the coming years totalling Â£170bn. Mr Letwin told MPs: \"The tide is going out on the chancellor\\'s credibility. He is spending, borrowing and taxing so much because he is not getting value for taxpayer\\'s money.\"\\n\\nVincent Cable, for the Liberal Democrats, accused Mr Brown of ducking tough choices.\\n\\nHe said: \"Last week the prime minister gave us the politics of fear; this week the chancellor has offered the economics of complacency. \"There are serious challenges ahead from the falling dollar and from the rapid downturn in the UK housing market and rising personal debt. But they have not been confronted.\" Mr Brown rejected the Lib Dem\\'s call to open up the government\\'s books to the National Audit Office, saying decisions on tax and spending should be made by ministers. Some economists say his forecasts on public finances are wishful thinking. BBC economic editor Evan Davis said the figures were plausible but also a gamble.\\n\\nMr Brown\\'s insistence he was not \"gloating\" was a pointed rebuttal of a warning from new European Commissioner Peter Mandelson. In his speech, he set out a 10-year childcare strategy for if Labour wins the next election.\\n\\nIt includes a Â£285m cash injection to extend paid maternity leave from six months to nine, with parents able to transfer leave from the mother to the father. He also promised to increase free nursery education for three and four-year-olds to 15 hours from April 2007. And funds would be provided to keep schools open from 0800 to 1800GMT to look after children while their parents were at work. Taken together, the measures would create a \"welfare state that is truly family-friendly for the first time in its history\", said Mr Brown. He also announced a cash hand-out for older pensioners, with payments of Â£50 for the over-70s as part of the winter fuel allowance. In a move ministers say should keep council tax rises below 5% next year, the chancellor said he was providing an extra Â£1bn for local councils. The money is expected to come from government departments such as health and education.\\n\\nMr Brown said he was set to meet his two fiscal rules - to borrow only to invest and keep debt \"low and sustainable\" - both in this economic cycle and the next. Borrowing figures for 2003/4 are Â£35bn - Â£2.5bn less than the Â£37.5bn predicted in March\\'s budget, as already announced by the Office for National Statistics. Borrowing is tipped to fall to Â£31bn by 2005/06 - but that is still Â£2bn more than Mr Brown predicted in his March budget. Inflation would be 1.75% next year and 2% in the years to follow, Mr Brown forecast. He also pledged an extra Â£105m for security and counter-terrorism. Business groups have welcomed efforts to improve competitiveness and invest more in skills and innovation. But there worries about the costs of more family-friendly working. Simon Sweetman, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \"The proposals on maternity leave have clearly been made with a general election in mind and with little thought to the impact on small employers.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'UK troops on Ivory Coast standby\\n\\nDowning Street has confirmed British troops are on standby in case they need to help evacuate several hundred UK citizens from Ivory Coast.\\n\\nThe news came as it emerged France had begun evacuating its hostages after days of anti-French demonstrations. Trouble flared after nine French peacekeepers were killed and President Jacques Chirac ordered the destruction of the Ivory Coast\\'s air force. A company of 100-120 UK troops is understood to have been put on standby. They are ready to fly out and secure the route from the embassy to the airport if called upon. Prime Minister Tony Blair\\'s official spokesman said: \"There are British nationals in Ivory Coast and as you can imagine we are making the usual contingency plans in case the situation deteriorates further, but that\\'s all I can say at this stage.\"\\n\\nHe added the situation would be monitored carefully in case evacuation became necessary. France has played a lead role in international peacekeeping in Ivory Coast - a former colony - after President Laurent Gbagbo broke an 18-month ceasefire with rebels bombing their positions and killing the nine French soldiers. The decision to destroy the African nation\\'s small air force prompted riots against French and other foreign nationals. The Spanish have already put their forces on standby to evacuate their nationals if necessary.\\n',\n",
       " 'Council tax rise \\'reasonable\\'\\n\\nWelsh councils should set their taxes at \"reasonable levels\" after being given an average funding increase of 6%, says the assembly government.\\n\\nFinance Minister Sue Essex said it was a \"good deal\" for local government. The Â£3.2bn settlement includes the \"full\" Â£7.4m from the UK Treasury announced by Chancellor Gordon Brown. But opposition parties said rebanding of council taxes would mean steep rises. In addition, Â£13.4m will come from the business support grant - a scheme which enables local authorities to keep part of business rates. She said where spending rises were kept to around 5% she was \"confident that councils will be able to set council taxes at reasonable levels.\" The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) had said on the eve of the announcement said that \"significant\" cuts to services may still be unavoidable. After the announcement WLGA finance spokesman Bob Wellington, of Torfaen, said it was vital that rises were minimsed. \"A limited amount of money has come available but this is not the answer to our problems,\" said Mr Wellington. \"It is vital that we start now to plan for future years and accept that resources will continue to reduce while pressures on services increase.\" On Monday, a delegation of north Wales councils visited Ms Essex to lobby for increased funds. Ms Essex said: \"I have listened to the views of local government and council tax payers and recognise the funding pressures and the concerns they have about council tax rises. \"I have met a large number of local authorities in recent weeks and I am aware of the pressures on them to provide local services and keep down the level of council tax, particularly for those people to are moving up a band due to the revaluation of domestic properties.\" She said council taxes could be kept at reasonable levels, \"even for those people who have moved up a band\".\\n\\nThe settlement includes a rise in the grant to help councils with the most deprived communities and a 16.4% rise in capital expenditure support. Ms Essex said: \"This is a good deal for local government, which will allow the well-managed councils of Wales to develop their services and charge reasonable levels of council tax. It is now a matter for council leaders to manage their budgets at a local level.\" Plaid Cymru\\'s local government spokesman Dai Lloyd called the announcement \"hugely disappointing\". He said: \"Wales and its local authorities have been short changed yet again. This is not whinging as the Labour Assembly Government so often claims - it is anger.\" \"This will mean either a massive hike in council tax, massive cuts in services provided by councils, or both.\" Mike German, leader of the Liberal Democrats in the assembly, claimed that one in three homes were still likely to face council tax rises due to rebanding. Mr German said: \"I know from my discussions with Welsh Liberal Democrat council leaders that they are doing their utmost to keep council tax to a minimum. But the random redistribution effect of rebanding...will create a great deal of difficulty.\" Conservative local government spokesman Glyn Davies said that for the minister to claim that the majority of council tax payers in Wales should see very little change \"is taking spin to the very verge of deception\". He added: \"Around a third of Welsh households have been re-valued upwards by at least one band and inevitably face increases into double figures.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'New drink limit \\'would cut toll\\'\\n\\nMore lives than previously thought could be saved by cutting drink-drive limits by a third, a report says.\\n\\nUniversity College London research claims cutting the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save 65 lives a year. The findings are being published by the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety as MPs are due to vote on the government\\'s Road Safety Bill. The bill includes changes to speeding fines but not to the drink-drive limit. The research, carried out by transport expert professor Richard Allsop, says cutting the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the UK\\'s roads compared with 2003. He estimates that this would save the country Â£119m a year.\\n\\nA previous estimate, contained in a 1998 Department of Transport Document, suggested such a move could save 50 lives a year. The findings are based on the assumption that drivers who currently keep below the legal limit would continue to do so were it to be lowered and that those who tend to exceed the limit slightly would also lower their drinking. Professor Allsop said: \"Reducing the limit from 80mg to 50mg can be expected to save around 65 lives a year or around half of those who die in accidents where the driver\\'s BAC [blood alcohol content] is within 30mg of the current limit. \"Only about one in 50 of those driving during weekend evenings and nights will need to moderate their drinking to achieve this and fewer still at other times.\"\\n\\nMinisters do not support a lower limit, saying it is not clear it would have a major impact on drink drive casualties. They believe educating drivers is more important. The AA Motoring Trust said it was not sure what affect dropping the limit would have on drivers\\' attitudes to drink-driving. Road safety head Andrew Howard said: \"It remains to be seen whether the social disapproval of the drinking driver will stay at the current rate if the alcohol limit is cut.\\n\\n\"Parliamentarians need to consider this carefully. Britons police themselves by consensus much more effectively than they do by weight of enforcement alone.\" Liberal Democrat transport spokesman John Thurso said drink-driving remained a \"major killer\", with figures showing a worrying rise in the number of accidents involving drivers who had been drinking. He said there had been a 29% drop in the number of drivers being breathalysed since 1997, which he said the government needed to address if it wanted to reduce the danger caused by drink-driving. The Road Safety Bill, which gets its second reading on Tuesday, would allow the results of roadside breath tests to be used in court - currently a blood test is needed. It also includes plans for a staggered speeding fines and points system, penalising drivers who exceed limits by a wide margin more than those who are caught going just over. These have been criticised by road safety campaigners, including Labour backbencher Gwyneth Dunwoody, who says it will reduce the incentive for drivers to stay within the limits in residential areas, leading to more road casualties. In an article for the Times newspaper, Ms Dunwoody, who chairs the Transport Select Committee, says: \"Slight increases to low car speeds increase hugely the risks to pedestrians and cyclists. \"It is quite simple: if you hit someone at 30mph, they have a 50 per cent chance of survival. If you are going at 40mph, nine times out of ten they will die.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'BMW cash to fuel Mini production\\n\\nLess than four years after the new Mini was launched, German car maker BMW has announced Â£100m of new investment.\\n\\nSome 200 new jobs are to be created at the Oxford factory, including modernised machinery and a new body shell production building. The result of the investment could be to raise output to more than 200,000 cars from 2007. The rise, from 189,000 last year, is a response to rapidly-rising demand and could help wipe out waiting lists. Before Wednesday\\'s announcement, BMW had invested some Â£280m in Mini production.\\n\\nSince its launch during summer 2001, the new Mini has gone from strength to strength.\\n\\nLast year, almost one in six cars sold by the BMW group was a Mini. The company admits that the success of the brand came despite scepticism from many in the industry. \"Our decision to produce a new Mini was not received well right away,\" said Norbert Reithofer, a member of the BMW management board. Initially, BMW said it would produce 100,000 Mini models a year at its vast Cowley factory on the outskirts of Oxford, but the target was quickly reached, then raised, time and time again. Not everyone is convinced that the boom can continue. \"The risk is that after they\\'ve invested massively in the brand, demand tapers off like it did with the new VW Beetle,\" said Brad Wernle, from Automotive News Europe.\\n\\nThe price of the car has also gone up. When it was launched, the cheapest Mini cost just more than Â£10,000. These days, buyers will have to fork out almost Â£11,500 to own a new Mini One, or even more for the Cooper S which costs up to Â£17,730. The Mini Convertible, which was launched last spring, costs up to Â£15,690 for the top model, and there is even a waiting list. Second-hand Minis are not cheap either. A Mini One bought when the model was launched should still fetch at least Â£8,000 for the cheapest model, while a used Cooper S is likely to be priced from Â£12,556, according to the-car buying website Parker\\'s. The consumers\\' association Which operates with slightly different numbers, yet it confirms that the Mini Cooper 1.6 depreciates slower than any other car, other than the Mercedes Benz C180 SE and the BMW 1 Series 116i SE.\\n\\nThe Cowley factory, which initially seemed far too large a production plant for just 100,000 Minis, is increasingly being put to good use.\\n\\nThere are plans to tear down old buildings and build new ones and there are rumours that a new paint shop could be included in the plans. BMW\\'s Mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the UK car maker Rover which it sold for Â£10 five years ago to the Phoenix consortium. In 1999, when BMW still owned Rover, the Oxford factory was producing the award-winning Rover 75. During that year, 3,500 people produced 56,000 cars. Last year, in the same factory, almost four times as many vehicles were produced by just 4,500 Mini-workers. The Mini factory\\'s current output is equally impressive when compared with the main Rover factory in Longbridge, which in 1999 produced 180,000 Rover cars. Last year, MG Rover, which employs more than 6,000 people, produced just 110,000 cars, though it hopes to land a deal with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) that could help double the number of cars produced at Longbridge. Indeed, Mini is not only producing more cars than MG Rover does; it remains ahead even when the current sales of Land Rovers and Range Rovers (which are made by the former Rover unit that BMW sold to Ford) are taken into account.\\n',\n",

       " 'Director Nair\\'s Vanity project\\n\\nIndian film director Mira Nair has said she was thrilled to be given the chance to make William Makepeace Thackeray\\'s novel Vanity Fair - as the book has been a favourite through her life.\\n\\nThe book is one of the classics of English literature - the story of scheming 19th Century social climber Becky Sharp, played in the film by Reese Witherspoon. Nair said that she jumped at the chance to work on the film, which she has - controversially - made in a Bollywood style, including two song-and-dance routines in the film\\'s second half. \"It was serendipity really - I was offered Vanity Fair by the studio Focus Features, who had distributed Monsoon Wedding,\" Nair told BBC World Service\\'s Masterpiece programme. \"They offered me their next-best thing, not realising that Vanity Fair had actually been one of my favourite novels since I was 16 years old in an Irish Catholic boarding school in India.\"\\n\\nSince her 1988 debut feature Salaam Bombay! - nominated for the Best Foreign Language Oscar and winner of Best First Feature at Cannes - Nair has become one of India\\'s most famous and respected directors. She is not restricted to Bollywood, however - she followed Salaam Bombay! with Mississippi Masala, starring Denzel Washington, and The Perez Family, her first Hollywood film.\\n\\nHer career peaked with Monsoon Wedding in 2001, which won the Golden Lion award at Venice. Nair\\'s Indian-style adaptation of Vanity Fair, however, has been attacked by critics in the US - where it only reached number eight at the box office in its opening week - who described the Bollywood elements as \"jarring.\" The film has a new ending, with Becky Sharp running off for a new life in India. But Nair said that her film had picked up on the way Thackeray - who was born in India but moved to England as a young man - had seen the world. \"First, when I was 16, it was Becky Sharp, who is a completely memorable character, because I recognised myself in her - I recognised all the ladies who did not want to be ladies, who wanted to buck the system that they were in,\" she said. \"But it was the sort of novel I somehow kept at the side of my bed for many years, and I would dip into every now and then and suddenly get completely mesmerised again. \"As I got older and read it, I think it was Thackeray\\'s clarity - his clear-sightedness about his own society, the fact that he was born in India but came to England as a young man - that gave him the eyes of an outsider, and yet he was an insider. \"That perspective was something I really loved.\"\\n\\nNair also defended her decision to cast an American actress - Reese Witherspoon - as Becky Sharp, despite the fact that all the rest of the cast are British or Irish. \"I cast intuitively - in my films I cast as many non-actors as I cast actors,\" she said. \"For me, it is intuition - I have to fall in love with an actor. It is a visceral response.\\n\\n\"Thackeray describes Becky Sharp as a minx. Also she\\'s described as someone who\\'s tiny, red-headed and thin. Reese had that completely minx-like irresistibility about her.\" Having won the role because she seemed physically perfectly suited to the part, however, Witherspoon then became pregnant. But Nair said that, though this had created the need for some filming tricks, it had in fact also helped the film. \"It was a self-fulfilling prophesy - when I first met her husband [actor Ryan Philippe], I said \\'knock her up, won\\'t you, I need some flesh on the girl\\',\" she joked. \"I\\'m not a fan of the underfed Los Angeles actor at all. This was, for me, about Becky Sharp being, eventually, a full-blown woman through the course of the film. \"I love the luminosity that pregnancy brings, I love the fleshiness, I love the ample bosom - it gave me much more to play with.\" Nair explained how camera tricks had been used to disguise Witherspoon\\'s \"bump\" in various scenes - including hiring a number of young boys in costumes to stand in front of her. \"She runs, she gets off coal carts, she jumps off horses - she does everything,\" Nair said. \"But there\\'s also a certain carriage with horses that is going to wipe the screen at a certain moment, because of the bump.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Gamer buys $26,500 virtual land\\n\\nA 22-year-old gamer has spent $26,500 (Â£13,700) on an island that exists only in a computer role-playing game (RPG).\\n\\nThe Australian gamer, known only by his gaming moniker Deathifier, bought the island in an online auction. The land exists within the game Project Entropia, an RPG which allows thousands of players to interact with each other. Entropia allows gamers to buy and sell virtual items using real cash, while fans of other titles often use auction site eBay to sell their virtual wares. Earlier this year economists calculated that these massively multi-player online role-playing games (MMORPGs) have a gross economic impact equivalent to the GDP of the African nation of Namibia.\\n\\n\"This is a historic moment in gaming history, and this sale only goes to prove that massive multi-player online gaming has reached a new plateau,\" said Marco Behrmann, director of community relations at Mindark, the game\\'s developer.\\n\\nThe virtual island includes a gigantic abandoned castle and beautiful beaches which are described as ripe for developing beachfront property. Deathifier will make money from his investment as he is able to tax other gamers who come to his virtual land to hunt or mine for gold. He has also begun to sell plots to people who wish to build virtual homes. \"This type of investment will definitely become a trend in online gaming,\" said Deathifier. The Entopia economy lets gamers exchange real currency into PED (Project Entropia Dollars) and back again into real money. Ten PEDs are the equivalent to one US dollar and typical items sold include iron ingots ($5) and shogun armour ($1.70) Gamers can theoretically earn money by accumulating PEDs through the acquisition of goods, buildings, and land in the Entropia universe. MMORPGs have become enormously popular in the last 10 years with hundreds of thousands of gamers living out alternate lives in fantasy worlds. Almost 200,000 people are registered players on Project Entropia.\\n',\n",

The sequel follows the master criminals as they try to pull off three major heists across Europe. It knocked last week\\'s number one, National Treasure, into third place. Wesley Snipes\\' Blade: Trinity was in second, taking $16.1m (Â£8.4m). Rounding out the top five was animated fable The Polar Express, starring Tom Hanks, and festive comedy Christmas with the Kranks.\\n\\nOcean\\'s Twelve box office triumph marks the fourth-biggest opening for a December release in the US, after the three films in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The sequel narrowly beat its 2001 predecessor, Ocean\\'s Eleven which took $38.1m (Â£19.8m) on its opening weekend and $184m (Â£95.8m) in total. A remake of the 1960s film, starring Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack, Ocean\\'s Eleven was directed by Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh. Soderbergh returns to direct the hit sequel which reunites Clooney, Pitt and Roberts with Matt Damon, Andy Garcia and Elliott Gould. Catherine Zeta-Jones joins the all-star cast. \"It\\'s just a fun, good holiday movie,\" said Dan Fellman, president of distribution at Warner Bros. However, US critics were less complimentary about the $110m (Â£57.2m) project, with the Los Angeles Times labelling it a \"dispiriting vanity project\". A milder review in the New York Times dubbed the sequel \"unabashedly trivial\".\\n',\n",

But Spider-Man 2 breaks that rule in two.\\n\\nIt's not fantastically deep but you get quickly drawn into the tale of Spidey versus Doc Ock and more so into the fate of poor Peter Parker. Gigantic action set pieces seamlessly work with more brooding personal torment and it all looks stunning. A few effects look false but Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and Alfred Molina make this compelling. The other universal rule is that DVDs of superhero films will have Making Of features only about the effects. This disc covers those special effects enough but as just one part of a detailed look at the film. Then there are commentaries, trailers and a blooper reel.\\n\\nSometimes quality comes in bulk: this set contains no less than 34 John Wayne films ranging from the Westerns and war movies to The Quiet Man.\\n\\nNow is that a Christmas present or what? Give this to someone on 24 December and you won't see them again until early in the New Year. It's not truly a complete collection and leans more toward Wayne's earlier films: there's no True Grit, for instance, though there is Hellraisers. The films look well transferred to DVD, though none has extras.\\n\\nIt was very daft but it knew it was and somehow this famous 1979 series became a cult favourite that's been long awaited on DVD. This set has the first season of Buck (Gil Gerard) and Wilma's (Erin Gray) tongue-in-cheek adventures and it's all as camp and gaudy as you remember. But it's also a disappointment. The US DVD has this and the more po-faced second season - and you can import it for just about the same price. The bigger omission, though, is that there are no extras. That's particularly disappointing because originally there were meant to be commentaries and stars Gerard and Gray had agreed to do them.\\n\",\n",

But the Cesar organisers modified their rules to allow the film to compete. The film, directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, received best actress, picture and director nominations.\\n\\nLast November a court judged the film was too American to compete in French film festivals. Two associations of French producers challenged Jeunet\\'s right to French government subsidies, because Warner Bros was a backer. The ruling meant the movie - which was filmed in France and used French actors and technicians - was not eligible to compete for French prizes. But Alain Terzian, president of Cesar organisers, the Academie des Arts et Techniques du Cinema, said the changes in eligibility rules, which allow films \"of French expression\", were made three months prior to the court decision. Other films in the best film category include Police drama 36, Quai Des Orfevres, Arnaud Desplechin\\'s Kings And Queen, Abdellatif Kechiche\\'s L\\'Esquive and France\\'s number one film at the 2004 box-office The Chorus.\\n\\nBest actors are Daniel Auteuil for 36, Mathieu Amalric for Kings And Queen, Gerard Jugnot for The Chorus, Philippe Torreton for L\\'Equipier and Benoit Poelvoorde for Podium.

Minister for Children, Young People and Families Margaret Hodge said new plans will ensure fosterers\\' allowances would be as fair as possible. However local authorities, which set and pay the allowances, are concerned about how the extra cash will be found. About 50,000 children live with foster families in the UK and carers have said they need more money to make ends meet.\\n\\nMs Hodge said: \"Foster carers must not be out of pocket when meeting the costs of caring for a looked after child - a crucial role in society. \"We need to make sure that arrangements for paying foster carers are as fair and transparent as possible. \"Our proposal for a national minimum rate shows we are serious about creating a better deal for foster carers and about encouraging more people to come forward and consider fostering as a worthwhile and rewarding opportunity.\" The government is seeking to amend the Children Bill, which passes through the Commons next week, to establish a national minimum payment.\\n\\nFostering Network executive director Robert Tapsfield criticised the existing system. \"There is just no logic to a system which values children differently depending on where they live. \"And with a shortage of over 8,000 foster carers in England, it\\'s not a sustainable situation to expect carers to fund foster care from their own pockets.\" The charity recommends a weekly payment of Â£108.49 for looking after a baby.

A report by the Commons work and pensions committee called for the agency to be wound up unless it improved its service within weeks. Chairman Sir Archy Kirkwood said: \"If the agency cannot be rescued, then it must be replaced.\"\\n\\nThe committee reached its conclusions after it found that nearly 250,000 cases have yet to be processed. It warned that it could be five years before the CSA was \"fit for purpose\", describing it as \"a failing organisation\" and \"in crisis\" with parents facing payment delays and inaccurate maintenance calculations. The report urged the CSA to draw up contingency plans, including the \"abandonment option\", to be presented to Parliament by Easter, in case the CS2 computer system could not be made to work.\\n\\nAnd responding to calls for the agency to be scrapped, Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme: \"I certainly wouldn\\'t rule out the nuclear option of moving to a completely new system. \"But I think the select committee would agree with me we would only do that when we were absolutely convinced that this system just isn\\'t going to work.\"\\n\\nThe MPs launched their inquiry into the CSA\\'s performance after it became clear that, despite the introduction of a simpler system of calculating maintenance payments for new cases in 2003, a backlog of claims was building up. The MPs found the Â£456m system from American IT giant EDS was \"nowhere near being fully functional and the number of dissatisfied, disenchanted and angry customers continues to escalate\". Faced with the committee\\'s criticism, the government has suspended its plan to cut the agency\\'s staff by 25%.

In his first comments since Sir Alan\\'s announcement, Mr Blair told BBC News he had not yet read the report in detail. But told BBC News: \"As far as I\\'m concerned, we have drawn a line under that.\"\\n\\nAsked if Mr Blunkett could return to frontline politics at some point, he replied: \"I have made my admiration for David very clear and it remains. \"He\\'s been a tremendous colleague, he\\'s done a great job for us, first as home secretary then as education secretary. The future is something we will have to approach in the future.\" The prime minister shrugged off claims from Conservative leader Michael Howard that he led a \"grubby government\". He said Mr Blunkett\\'s integrity remained intact: \"He was the person first of all who asked for this inquiry to be set up. He accepted that what he originally thought had happened had not happened, he said. \"But I think Sir Alan Budd also accepted there wasn\\'t some conspiracy or cover-up and I just think a line should be drawn under now and we should move on.\"\\n\\nEarlier, Mr Howard said: \"There does need to be another inquiry, a judge-led inquiry. There were so many questions that weren\\'t answered.\" There was \"deceit at the heart of government\" which was not limited to the visa affair, he argued. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten also said there was \"a strong case for a judge-led judicial review\".\\n\\nHe said: \"Next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa. It may be about something even more important than that.\" Mr Blunkett quit as home secretary last week after being told in advance of Sir Alan\\'s findings. In a statement, the ex-home secretary said he accepted the inquiry\\'s findings.

The complaint said an \"unidentified individual... has recently misappropriated and disseminated confidential information\". The lawsuit was filed with the Santa Clara California Superior Court. Apple is famously secretive about its future product launches while Apple users are equally famous for speculating about new technology from the company. Fans have speculated in recent weeks about the possibility of a new type of iPod being announced at the MacWorld conference.\\n\\nApple said in the seven-page complaint, filed on 13 December, that it did not know the \"true names or capacities, whether individual, associate, corporate or otherwise,\" of the defendants. The company said it would amend the complaint once they had discovered the names of those who had allegedly leaked information. It is not the first time Apple has sued people who have posted information about future products on the internet. In December 2002, Apple sued a former contractor who allegedly posted online drawings, images and engineering details of the company\\'s PowerMac G4 computer. In a statement, Apple said of the current lawsuit: \"Apple has filed a civil complaint against unnamed individuals who we believe stole our trade secrets and posted detailed information about an unannounced Apple product on the internet.\"\\n',\n",

Due to the Thanksgiving holiday, the film opened on Wednesday, bringing its total takings to $21.6m (Â£11.4m). Top of the box office for a second week was action movie National Treasure. The family adventure, starring Nicolas Cage, took $33.1m (Â£17.m), ahead of animated comedy The Incredibles - now in its fourth week in the charts - which took $24.1m (Â£12.7m).\\n\\nLast week Oliver Stone\\'s film met with scathing reviews from US critics. The film stars Irish actor Colin Farrell as one of history\\'s most celebrated leaders - a relentless and arrogant warrior who conquered much of the known world by the age of 25. In particular, its portrayal of Alexander as a bisexual has met with a hostile reception and the threat of legal action from Greek lawyers. \"Though the battles have the blood-and-sinew bravado you expect from Oliver Stone, this three-hour buttnumbathon is hamstrung by a hectoring grandiosity,\" wrote one reviewer in Rolling Stone magazine. Others poured scorn on Farrell\\'s bleached hair and Angelina Jolie\\'s unwieldy accent, which Variety called \"a combination of Mata Hari and Count Dracula\" . But novelist Gore Vidal defended the film, saying it was \"barrier-breaking\" for its frank depiction of bisexuality.\\n\\nIn Sweden last Thursday, to pick up a lifetime achievement award at the Stockholm International Film Festival, Stone expressed the hope that Alexander might be better appreciated in Europe. \"One of the reasons I am being honoured here is Europeans tend to see me a little differently than they do in the US,\" said the director behind JFK, Platoon and Born on the Fourth of July. He added Alexander \"was not an easy movie, but then I\\'ve never made easy movies\".\\n',\n",
       " 'US box office set for record high\\n\\nTicket sales at the US box office are predicted to break records this year, with figures expected to reach $9.4 billion, beating 2002\\'s all-time high.\\n\\nOverall figures could be dampened by the lack of a Christmas hit like last year\\'s Oscar-winning Lord of the Rings. Traditionally, ticket sales during the festive season account for 20% of the annual total. Although admissions have actually fallen this year, the predicted high is down to increasing ticket prices. According to Exhibitor Relations President Paul Dergarabedian, the average cost of a cinema ticket could be as high as $6.25 in 2004, compared to $5.80 in 2002. This year some of the biggest hits such as The Passion of the Christ and Fahrenheit 9/11 came from outside the major studios which are usually responsible for the key blockbusters.\\n\\n\"Many of the films that did well (with audiences) are not necessarily the films that made a lot of money,\" said Mr Dergarabedian. He added that surprise hits had come from some of the more art-house offerings such as Napoleon Dynamite and critical hit Sideways. Sony Pictures, responsible for hits like Spiderman 2 and The Grudge, are expected to top domestic market share for the second time in three years, with $1 billion-plus in sales for the third consecutive year. Sony Pictures Entertainment vice chairman. Jeff Blake said: \"We had a really diverse slate this year, and... certainly we pulled off one of the surprises with Grudge.\" Horror movie The Grudge cost Sony $10 million to make but brought in $110 million. It\\'s the latest in a recent trend for Hollywood studios to back the upper and lower ends of the market, whilst ignoring the middle. Warner Inc are likely to end the year in second place on market share with around $1.25 billion, with Disney at number three.\\n',\n",

Mr Howard is expected to tell activists in Kent that voters\\' tolerance and desire to help others are being abused. Other parties and refugee agencies have already attacked Tory plans for annual limits on numbers.\\n\\nMr Howard said Britain should take its fair share of the world\\'s \"genuine refugees\".\\n\\n\"The anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz - where my grandmother was murdered along with over a million others - has reminded all of us that we have a moral responsibility to those fleeing persecution,\" he was due to say. \"But if we are to fulfil responsibility, we have to get a grip of the system. \"Fair play matters. People want a government that upholds the rules - not one that turns a blind eye when they are bent and abused,\" he said. \"And let\\'s be clear. Our asylum system is being abused - and with it Britain\\'s generosity.\" Earlier this week, Mr Howard said his party\\'s plans to cut immigration were not racist, arguing they would make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees. If elected, his party would institute an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas.\\n\\nThat prompted some charities to say the plans would put refugees\\' lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled. \"If we have a moral responsibility towards people fleeing persecution, then these policies will not provide a safe haven,\" said Hannah Ward of the Refugee Council. \"If people turn up in the UK asking for help they will be turned away. Michael Howard\\'s policy effectively means there is no safe haven in the UK. \"When it comes to costs, then perhaps we should start with how decisions are made on asylum seekers. So many of them are shown to be wrong - one in five decisions that are appealed are successfully overturned, rising to half for some nationalities. \"We need good quality decision-making on asylum applications because it is delays in the system which cost so much.\"\\n\\nTony Blair said Labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the Tory plans. \"By cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders, they will actually make the problem worse,\" said Mr Blair. Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said there needed to be a quick, fair and firm asylum system. But he said it was \"absolutely disgusting\" to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees. The Conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set. On Monday, Mr Howard said: \"It\\'s not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it.\"\\n',\n",

Some 63% of respondents in the Sunday Times poll thought his former lover - Kimberly Quinn - acted vindictively and 61% that he had been right to resign. YouGov polled a weighted sample of 1,981 voters online on 16-18 December. Mr Blunkett resigned as Home Secretary on Wednesday after an inquiry uncovered an e-mail showing a visa application by Mrs Quinn's former nanny had been speeded up. Sir Alan Budd's inquiry also found Mr Blunkett's account of events had been wrong. Almost a quarter (21%) of those polled for the Sunday Times said he should return to the Cabinet straight after the election. One in four said he should be back in the Government's top ranks within a year or two while 39% opposed a comeback.\\n\\nThree-quarters said Mr Blunkett was right to go to court for the right to see Mrs Quinn's son - whom he says he fathered - and just 14% voiced sympathy for Mrs Quinn. A total of 53% of those polled said they had sympathy for Mr Blunkett, with 40% saying they did not. Forty-three per cent thought Mr Blunkett had done a good job as home secretary and 17% disagreed.

A majority, 52%, said Chancellor Gordon Brown had done a good job and just 16% disagreed.\\n\\nA second poll for the Independent on Sunday found that support for all political parties remained largely unchanged after the Blunkett controversy. Labour lead the Conservatives by 39% to 34% with the Liberal Democrats on 19%. CommunicateResearch interviewed 401 people before David Blunkett's resignation and 601 afterwards. Some 82% said Mr Blunkett had set a good example by wanting to take responsibility for the child he says is his, but 42% backed his legal action compared to 45% who thought it was unbecoming. Thirty per cent said the affair showed Mr Blunkett could not be trusted as a minister while 63%, disagreed.\\n\",\n",

Despite being told he was a \"nutter who died at sea\" she found a reference to Mr Pound on Friends Reunited. Lucy\\'s mother kept her pregnancy secret and had her adopted at four weeks. Mr Pound found out about it last year. That happened when Lucy wrote to his Parliamentary office saying she believed he was her father.\\n\\nMr Pound, who is now married with two other teenage children, said: \"I was a nutter and I was a sailor but I wasn\\'t dead.\" He said his first reaction was to wonder if he was victim of a \"set-up\" but he then realised all the dates fitted. \"It was a pretty horrible thing with a pretty happy ending. I felt guilt in the marrow of my bones,\" said the Ealing North MP. \"I don\\'t blame Lucy\\'s mother. I was pretty much out of control. I was 18 when she was conceived. It was a different time - it was pretty wild.\"\\n\\nMr Pound says he rang Lucy as soon as he got her letter, they met up and have been in contact ever since. Describing that first meeting at London\\'s King Cross station, he said: \"The earth went from under my feet ... We were walking across the Euston Road and I took her arm to take her across and there was an immediate connection. \"We were finishing each other sentences.\" Lucy, who was adopted by a family from Essex, wants to remain anonymous for the sake of her adoptive father and her children.

The chancellor has previously planned the party\\'s election strategy but this time the role will be filled by Alan Milburn - a key ally of Tony Blair. The premier insisted Mr Brown will have a key role in Labour\\'s campaign, and praised his handling of the economy.\\n\\nWriting in the Guardian newspaper, Mr Brown outlined his view of the direction New Labour should be taking. \"As our manifesto and our programme for the coming decade should make clear, Labour\\'s ambition is not simply tackling idleness but delivering full employment; not just attacking ignorance, disease and squalor but promoting lifelong education, good health and sustainable communities.\" BBC political editor Andrew Marr said that Mr Brown\\'s article was \"a warning shot\" to Mr Blair not to try and cut him out of the manifesto writing process. \"It was, as always, coded and careful... but entirely deliberate,\" was Mr Marr\\'s assessment. The prime minister was asked about Mr Brown\\'s article and about his election role when he appeared on BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme. Mr Blair said a decision had yet to be taken over how the election would be run but the chancellor\\'s role would be \"central\". Mr Blair argued that under New Labour the country had changed for the better and that was \"in part\" because of Mr Brown\\'s management of the economy. And he pledged childcare would be a \"centrepiece\" of Labour\\'s manifesto. He also predicted the next general election will be a \"tough, tough fight\" for New Labour. But the prime minister insisted he did not know what date the poll would take place despite speculation about 5 May. Mr Blair said he was taking \"nothing for granted\" ahead of the vote - warning that the Tory strategy was to win power via the back door by hinting they were aiming to cut Labour\\'s majority instead of hoping for an outright win.\\n',\n",

It saw off competition from big-budget French epic, A Very Long Engagement, and the box-office hit, The Chorus. US film Lost in Translation won the award for best foreign feature. The wistful romantic comedy directed by Sofia Coppola has already won several awards, including an Oscar for best screenplay in 2004. Its late release in France made it a contender for this year\\'s Cesars.\\n\\nThe low-budget L\\'Esquive depicts the travails of a group of youth getting ready to perform a school play by the 18th-Century dramatist, Marivaux. The actors are mostly amateurs and the action is set in the impoverished suburbs of Paris, home to thousands of immigrants from North Africa and their children. Kechiche said he made the film because he \"wanted to show people we don\\'t normally see at the cinema\". A Very Long Engagement, a World War I drama featuring Audrey Tautou, won five Cesar awards. The Chorus, a film about a schoolteacher who introduces an unruly classroom to the pleasures of classical singing, won two awards - for best music and best sound.

He told a London news conference that Veritas - Latin for \"truth\" - would avoid the old parties\\' \"lies and spin\". UKIP leader Roger Knapman says he was glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk.\\n\\nMr Kilroy-Silk promised a \"firm but fair\" policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election. He said Veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks. And he announced the party would be holding a leadership election. On Thursday he is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election - that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon\\'s Ashfield seat. He was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP\\'s two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney who is now Veritas\\' deputy leader. UKIP\\'s chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left.\\n\\nMr Kilroy-Silk announced his decision to quit UKIP at a public meeting in Hinckley, Leicestershire last week. It came after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had \"gone AWOL\" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June\\'s European elections. \"While UKIP has turned its back on the British people, I shall not,\" he said. \"I will be standing at the next general election. I shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes I believe in. \"And, unlike the old parties, we shall be honest, open and straight.\"\\n\\nMr Hockney also left UKIP saying Mr Kilroy-Silk would \"deliver better\" as the leader of a Eurosceptic party. A spokesman for UKIP called on Mr Hockney to quit the London Assembly. The party asserts that Mr Hockney \"has a moral obligation, if not a legal one\" to stand down. Its leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. \"He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now \\'goodbye\\',\" he said. UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been \"straightforward\" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.\\n\\nThis is just what the Europhiles pray for. As the main Eurosceptic party, UKIP should try to resolve its differences with Kilroy to show a united front and give the UK public a serious political voice against Europe. Having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further.\\n\\nThank goodness that Kilroy-Silk has gone - now UKIP at least has a chance in the election!\\n\\nIt is very sad to see the cause of Britain regaining its proper relationship with Europe damaged by this split within UKIP. Robert Kilroy-Silk could have a lot to offer. Instead we have a split party and a damaged cause. Under the present electoral system, people must work together, and small parties have no hope of representation. Last summer, UKIP achieved a major advance, partly and only partly due to Kilroy-Silk. It is a great shame this has been dissipated in in-fighting.\\n\\nUKIP has a wide platform of policies, not just withdrawal from the EU. This Kilroy-Silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party. Neither the English Democrats nor the New Party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes. Veritas is the beginning of the end for Kilroy-Silk.\\n\\nIf he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another.\\n\\nSo UKIP was good enough for him to lead, not good enough for him to follow!\\n\\nInteresting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a Latin name!\\n\\nEvery opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti-Europe feeling in this country. Kilroy-Silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue. He is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience. We wants quality schools, top hospitals, clean and efficient public transport, punishments that fit the crime, limited asylum, a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes. It needs courage and honesty, two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians. Kilroy-Silk may just have those very qualities. Recruit the right colleagues, Robert, and your time may have come!\\n\\nWell if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary MP then go out and start up your own Party. It\\'s all flash and no real policy here\\n\\nLet\\'s hope this is the start of both UKIP and Kilroy-Silk slipping into obscurity.\\n\\nVeritas? The name will doom it. But perhaps I am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn Latin in the classroom do they not? The whole essence of what RKS represents is Euroscepticism, so explain to me how the too-twee label of Veritas symbolises that?\\n',\n",

The minister had been saying she understood there was a perception that stop and search was aimed at one community, but that was not what was happening, the spokesman said.\\n\\n\"What is happening is that those powers are aimed at those who are suspected of carrying out or planning certain activity who happen to come from one community. \"It is not aimed at a particular community, it is not police policy to aim these powers at a particular community,\" he added. Statistics showed that of the 17 people found guilty of terrorist acts in the UK since the 11 September attacks, only four of the 12 whose ethnic backgrounds were known were Muslim, he added Figures published last week showed that people from ethnic minorities were increasingly likely to be targeted by police stop and search tactics.\\n\\nFigures showed that, for 2003/2004, Asians were 1.9 times more likely to be stopped and searched, compared with 1.7 times more likely in the previous year. Separate figures on police searches in England and Wales carried out under the Terrorism Act 2000 showed that ethnic minorities were more likely to be targeted. Muslim groups have repeatedly claimed that their communities are being victimised under terror laws. In 2003/2004, 12.5% searches under the laws were on Asian people, even though they make up 4.7% of the population. Last July, the police were accused of Islamophobia by Muslim groups after stop and search figures showed the numbers of Asians targeted had risen by 300% since the introduction of anti-terror laws.\\n',\n",
       " 'Royal couple watch nation\\'s mood\\n\\nPrince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles are awaiting the nation\\'s reaction after announcing they are to be married on 8 April.\\n\\nMrs Parker Bowles will take the title HRH Duchess of Cornwall after a civil ceremony to be held at Windsor Castle. A Daily Telegraph poll of 1,313 people suggests two-thirds of Britons support the couple\\'s decision to marry. But only 40% think Mrs Parker Bowles should become Princess Consort as planned after Charles becomes king. Some 47% believe she should have no title, while 7% think she should become queen.\\n\\nThe poll also found that the majority of Britons would prefer the monarchy to miss a generation, with the Queen handing the throne to her grandson Prince William, 22, on her death or abdication. On Thursday night, Prince Charles, 56, and Mrs Parker Bowles, 57, hosted a dinner at Windsor Castle, their first public appearance since announcing their engagement. Mrs Parker Bowles said the prince went down on one knee to propose and added: \"I\\'m just coming down to earth.\" She displayed her diamond engagement ring - a Royal Family heirloom - to reporters. Charles said he and his wife-to-be were \"absolutely delighted\". Their marriage will end years of speculation on a relationship which dates back to 1970.\\n\\nThe Queen and Duke of Edinburgh said the news had made them \"very happy\". Princes William and Harry said they are \"very happy\" and wish the couple \"all the luck in the future\". The wedding will be a civil ceremony followed by a service of prayer and dedication in St George\\'s Chapel at which the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, will preside.\\n\\nThe marriage is likely to be a sensitive issue because Mrs Parker Bowles is divorced and her former husband is still alive. If he became king, Charles would be the supreme governor of the Church of England and some Anglicans remain opposed to the remarriage of divorcees. \"His divorce from Diana and the disappointment the country felt over how Diana had been treated... opened up a sense of disillusionment with [Prince Charles],\" said Ros Coward, who wrote the authorised biography of Diana, princess of Wales. The Archbishop of Canterbury said: \"I am pleased that Prince Charles and Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles have decided to take this important step.\" Tony Blair said he was \"delighted\" for the couple and offered his congratulations, as did Conservative leader Michael Howard and Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy. Australia\\'s Prime Minister John Howard also offered his congratulations, adding that their decision to marry was a \"sensible and a good thing\". Mrs Parker Bowles has joined the prince at numerous engagements in recent years - mostly at evening events for The Prince\\'s Trust. Clarence House staff were at pains to point out that she attended these events in a private capacity.\\n',\n",
       " 'UK heading wrong way - Howard\\n\\nTony Blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing Britain and has failed, Michael Howard has said.\\n\\n\"Britain is heading in the wrong direction\", the Conservative leader said in his New Year message. Mr Blair\\'s government was a \"bossy, interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals,\" he added. But Labour\\'s campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp responded: \"Britain is working, don\\'t let the Tories wreck it again\". Mr Howard also paid tribute to the nation\\'s character for its generous response to the Asian quake disaster. The catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year, Mr Howard said.\\n\\n\"We watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief. The scale, the speed, the ferocity of what happened on Boxing Day is difficult to grasp. \"Yet Britain\\'s response has shone a light on our nation\\'s character. The last week has shown that the warm, caring heart of Britain beats as strong as ever.\" He went on to reflect on the values that \"most Britons hold dear\". Looking ahead to the coming general election, he pledged to \"turn these beliefs into reality\" and set out the choices he says are facing Britain. \"How much tax do people want to pay? Who will give taxpayers value for money, the clean hospitals and good, disciplined schools they want? \"Who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system?\"\\n\\nMr Blair has failed to tackle these problems, he claimed, saying he has the \"wrong solution\" to them.\\n\\n\"The result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives, undermining enterprise and denying people choice. \"Worst of all, it is a government that has wasted people\\'s money and failed to tackle the problems families face today.\" The Tories, he said, can cut crime and improve public services without asking people to pay more taxes. \"We can have progress without losing what makes Britain great - its tolerance, the respect for the rule of law, the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential. \"We simply need to change direction. The election will give Britain the chance to change.\" This is the record Mr Blair will have to defend in the coming months, he said, urging voters to hold him to account.\\n\\nBut Labour spokesman Mr Kemp said: \"It would be more appropriate for this message to come out on 1 April, not 1 January.\" \"Let us never forget that when Michael Howard was in government Britain suffered mass unemployment, 15% interest rates, record home repossessions, and the introduction of the poll tax. \"With Labour Britain is working. Rather than alluding to false promises Michael Howard should be starting 2005 with an apology to the British people for the misery that the government, of which he was a member, inflicted upon the country.\\n',\n",

It also expressed concern that, for the 10th year, the European Court of Auditors had qualified the EU accounts. The NAO urged the government to push for improvements in reporting fraud. It said member states needed to be more accountable on how money was spent. The report said: \"Member states still do not report fraud and other irregularities to the European Anti-Fraud Office on a consistent basis.\\n\\n\"As the court has now qualified its opinion on the Community accounts for a decade, it is essential for all the authorities involved to contribute to the strengthening of the audit of EU revenue and expenditure and improving accountability for the financial management and use of EU resources.\" It said there were 922 cases of reported fraud or irregularities in EU funds in the UK in 2003, worth Â£38.5m (52m euros), up from 831 cases worth Â£35.7m in 2002. At the same time, reported fraud throughout the EU dropped from 10,276 cases worth Â£808m to 8,177 cases worth Â£644m. Edward Leigh, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said Britain had to set an example when it assumed the EU presidency.\\n\\n\"Any fraud in other member states is potentially fraud against the UK taxpayer, given that we are the second largest net contributor to the Community,\" he said. \"Departments responsible for administering EU funds need to make sure that they\\'re doing everything possible to weed out improper spending. \"The government must take the opportunity afforded by the UK presidency of the EU to press the Commission and other member states to take an equally robust stance against fraud and irregularity, and raise overall standards of financial management.\" A spokesman for the European Anti-Fraud Office said the organisation agreed with the NAO\\'s assessment of fraud reporting. \"The quality of reporting does differ from member state to member state, and there is room for improvement,\" spokesman Jorg Wojahn said. He added that there is generally good co-operation with member states and the anti-fraud office on specific cases of fraud, with the statistics studied by NAO providing a \"good overview for planning strategic ways of detecting fraud\".\\n',\n",

British actors in attendance include nominees Clive Owen, Imelda Staunton, Kate Winslet and director Mike Leigh. The Aviator leads the shortlist, but critics believe the night may belong to Clint Eastwood\\'s Million Dollar Baby. A recent poll of US pundits found Eastwood\\'s boxing drama had become the new favourite to win best film over the Howard Hughes biopic.\\n\\nIf the 74-year-old does win, he will become the oldest person ever to be named best director at the ceremony. UK critics still favour The Aviator for best film, but believe the best director title will generate a close fought battle between Eastwood and Martin Scorsese.\\n\\nScorsese has never won the best director prize, despite four previous nominations for films including Raging Bull, Goodfellas and Gangs of New York. Eastwood has won best director once before, for Unforgiven in 1993. Most experts predict the twice-nominated Jamie Foxx will win best actor for his portrayal of singer Ray Charles, while Vera Drake star Imelda Staunton looks likely to lose out in the best actress field to Hilary Swank in Million Dollar Baby. The UK\\'s highest hopes remain with Clive Owen, who has scooped both the Golden Globe and the Bafta for his supporting role in Closer. Actor and comedian Chris Rock will host the event, which will be broadcast with a seven-second time delay to allow censors to cut out any unsuitable content.\\n\\n\"We have the bleep machine ready, but bleeps will be used as needed,\" producer Gil Cates told reporters. However, he added that he strongly disapproved of the growing tendency to censor live broadcasts on US TV.\\n\\nHe also played down fears that Rock, who is known for using strong language in his stand-up routines, might cause controversy on the night. The 40-year-old comic has already promised not to swear live on air during the show. \"Chris has a sense of humour and everything he says is really said humorously,\" Cates said. \"You need a movie star and someone who is a stand-up comic so they can deal with the vicissitudes of the show.\" Security will also be tight, with police employing a system to detect sarin nerve gas. \"We are pulling out all the stops,\" said John Miller, chief of counterterrorism at the Los Angeles Police Department. The show is \"a symbol of American culture and has the potential to be a high-visibility target,\" he added. Meanwhile, organisers have erected a canopy over the red carpet following an outbreak of torrential rain in Los Angeles over the past week. Cates said the covers would be removed if the threat of wet weather receded. Details have also emerged of the contents of this year\\'s gift bags, which are given to nominees and presenters on the night. This year\\'s bags will include a gift certificate for a luxury beach resort, a pair of mink eyelashes and a kitchen set with a year\\'s supply of tea and coffee.

Festival director Dieter Kosslick says this strong showing signals \"a new consciousness for European films\". \"They\\'re on an incredible winning streak,\" he told the Reuters agency. \"This isn\\'t to say there aren\\'t any good American films,\" he continued. \"It\\'s just that there are more good European films.\"\\n\\nHowever, Mr Kosslick refused to accept that widespread opposition to the Iraq war had turned audiences against Hollywood imports. \"There is no anti-American mood,\" he said. Some 350 films will be screened at this year\\'s festival, with a further 300 shown at the European Film Market that runs alongside it. More than a dozen celebrities are scheduled to attend, among them Will Smith, Kevin Spacey and Keanu Reeves. But Mr Kosslick says more would be coming had the Academy Awards not been brought forward to 27 February. \"I\\'m not worried that we won\\'t be able to fill the red carpet with stars,\" he said, though he admitted the festival may be moved to January next year to avoid a similar clash.

       " 'How to make a gigapixel picture\\n\\nThe largest digital panoramic photo in the world has been created by researchers in the Netherlands.\\n\\nThe finished image is 2.5 billion pixels in size - making it about 500 times the resolution of images produced by good consumer digital cameras. The huge image of Delft was created by stitching together 600 single snaps of the Dutch city taken at a fixed spot. If printed out in standard 300 dots per inch resolution, the picture would be 2.5m high and 6m long.\\n\\nThe researchers have put the image on a website which lets viewers explore the wealth of detail that it captures. Tools on the page let viewers zoom in on the city and its surroundings in great detail. The website is already proving popular and currently has more than 200,000 visitors every day.\\n\\nThe image was created by imaging experts from the Dutch research and technology laboratory TNO which created the 2.5 gigapixel photo as a summer time challenge.\\n\\nThe goal of the project was to be one of the first groups to make gigapixel images. The first image of such a size was manually constructed by US photographer Max Lyons in November 2003. That image portrayed Bryce Canyon National Park, in Utah, and was made up of 196 separate photographs. The panorama of Delft is a little staid in contrast to the dramatic rockscape captured in Mr Lyons\\' image. \"He did it all by hand, which was an enormous effort, and we got the idea that if you use automatic techniques, it would be feasible to build a larger image,\" said Jurgen den Hartog, one of the TNO researchers behind the project. \"We were not competing with Mr Lyons, but it started as a lunchtime bet.\"\\n\\nThe Dutch team used already available technologies, although it had to upgrade them to be able to handle the high-resolution image.\\n\\n\"We had to rewrite almost all the tools,\" Me den Hartog told the BBC News website. \"All standard Windows viewers available would not be able to load such a large image, so we had to develop one ourselves.\" The 600 component pictures were taken on July 2004 by a computer-controlled camera with a 400 mm lens. Each image was made to slightly overlap so they could be accurately arranged into a composite. The stitching process was also done automatically using five powerful PCs over three days. Following the success of this project, and with promises of help from others, the TNO team is considering creating a full 360-degree panoramic view of another Dutch city, with even higher resolution.\\n',\n",
       " \"Europe backs digital TV lifestyle\\n\\nHow people receive their digital entertainment in the future could change, following the launch of an ambitious European project.\\n\\nIn Nice last week, the European Commission announced its Networked & Electronic Media (NEM) initiative. Its broad scope stretches from the way media is created, through each of the stages of its distribution, to its playback. The Commission wants people to be able to locate the content they desire and have it delivered seamlessly, when on the move, at home or at work, no matter who supplies the devices, network, content, or content protection scheme. More than 120 experts were in Nice to share the vision of interconnected future and hear pledges of support from companies such as Nokia, Intel, Philips, Alcatel, France Telecom, Thomson and Telefonica. It might initially appear to be surprising that companies in direct competition are keen to work together. But again and again, speakers stated they could not see incompatible, stand-alone solutions working. A long-term strategy for the evolution and convergence of technologies and services would be required.\\n\\nThe European Commission is being pragmatic in its approach. They have identified that many groups have defined the forms of digital media in the areas that NEM encompasses. The NEM approach is to take a serious look at what is available and what is in the pipeline, pick out the best, bring them together and identify where the gaps are. Where it finds holes, it will develop standards to fill them. What is significant is that such a large and powerful organisation has stated its desire for digital formats to be open to all and work on any gadget. This is bound to please, if not surprise, many individuals and user organisations who feel that the wishes of the holder of rights to content are normally considered over and above those of the consumer. Many feel that the most difficult and challenging area for the Commission will be to identify a solution for different Digital Rights Management (DRM) schemes. Currently DRM solutions are incompatible, locking certain types of purchased content, making them unplayable on all platforms. With the potential of having a percentage of every media transaction that takes place globally, the prize for being the supplier of the world's dominant DRM scheme is huge. Although entertainment is an obvious first step, it will encompass the remote provisions of healthcare, energy efficiency and control of the smart home. The 10-year plan brings together the work of many currently running research projects that the EC has been funding for a number of years.\\n\\nSimon Perry is the editor of the Digital Lifestyles website, which covers the impact of technology on media\\n\",\n",
       " 'Robotic pods take on car design\\n\\nA new breed of wearable robotic vehicles that envelop drivers are being developed by Japanese car giant Toyota.\\n\\nThe company\\'s vision for the single passenger in the 21st Century involves the driver cruising by in a four-wheeled leaf-like device or strolling along encased in an egg-shaped cocoon that walks upright on two feet. Both these prototypes will be demonstrated, along with other concept vehicles and helper robots, at the Toyota stand at the Expo 2005 in Aichi, Japan, in March 2005. The models are being positioned as so-called personal mobility devices, which have few limits. The open leaf-like \"i-unit\" vehicle is the latest version of the concept which the company introduced last year. Built using environmentally friendly plant-based materials, the single passenger unit is equipped with intelligent transport system technologies that allow for safe autopilot driving in specially equipped lanes. The model allows the user to make tight on-the-spot turns, move upright amongst other people at low speeds and can be easily switched into a reclining position at higher speeds. Body colours can be customized to suit individual preferences and a personal recognition system offers both information and music.\\n\\nAlso on display at the show will be the egg-shaped \"i-foot\". This is a two-legged mountable robot like device that can be controlled with a joystick.\\n\\nStanding at a height of well over seven feet (2.1 metres), the unit can walk along at a speed of about 1.35km/h (0.83mph) and navigate staircases into the bargain. Mounting and dismounting is accomplished with the aid of the bird-like legs that bend over backwards. \"They are clearly what we call concept vehicles, innovative ideas which have yet to be transformed into potential products and which are a few years away from actual production,\" said Dr David Gillingwater from the Transport Studies Group at Loughborough University. \"They clearly have eye-catching appeal, which is in part the name of the game here, and are linked to the iMac and iPod-type niche which Apple have been responsible for developing and leading in recent years - new, different, hi-tech, image conscious products. \"As always with these concept vehicles, it is difficult to see \\'who\\' they would appeal to and what their role would be in the \\'personal transport\\' marketplace.\"\\n\\nThe personal transport arena is taking on a new dimension though with futuristic devices that augment human capabilities. Toyota\\'s prototypes represent the latest incarnation of wearable exoskeletons in a vehicular form that is specially focused on transport. Powered robotic exoskeletons have been the focus of much US military research over the years and Japan seems to have jumped onto the bandwagon with a wave of products being developed for specific applications. With an emerging range of devices targeted towards the ageing world population, care giving and the military, wearable exoskeletons seem to represent a new line of future technologies that meet an individual\\'s particular mobility needs. While Toyota\\'s prototypes are geared towards mass transport, the company says that the vehicles will allow the elderly and the disabled to achieve independent mobility.\\n\\nExperts, though, are a bit sceptical of their acceptance in this area.\\n\\n\"Those with arguably the greatest needs for this sort of assistance, now and certainly in the future, are the elderly and infirm people,\" Dr Gillingwater told the BBC News website. \"You have to ask whether these sorts of vehicles will appeal to these groups.\" Design considerations also exist. Dr Erel Avineri, of the Centre for Transport and Society at the University of the West of England in Bristol said: \"The design of the introduced mobility devices is not completely adjusted to the specific needs of the elderly and the disabled. \"For example, one problem that many older passengers experience is limited ability to rotate the neck and upper body, making it difficult to look to the side and back when backing up. \"It looks like the visual design of the device interior does not consider this need. This and other human-factors related issues in the design of such devices are not the only issues that should be considered,\" said Dr Avineri. \"In general, introducing a new technology requires the passenger to change behaviour patterns that have served the older passenger for decades. Elderly users might not necessarily accept such innovation. \"This may be another barrier to the commercial success of such a vehicle.\" Such single-person vehicles may find a relatively small market niche and may be more suited towards specialised applications rather than revolutionising the face of mass transport. \"The concept of personal mobility behind these sorts of innovations is great but they beg a huge number of questions,\" said Dr Gillingwater. \"What\\'s their range? How user-friendly will they really be? What infrastructure will be required to allow these vehicles to be used. \"Overall I think these vehicles pose a number of important questions than provide answers or solutions.\"\\n',\n",

Yukos\\' owner Menatep Group says it will ask Rosneft to repay a loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets. Rosneft already faces a similar $540m repayment demand from foreign banks. Legal experts said Rosneft\\'s purchase of Yugansk would include such obligations. \"The pledged assets are with Rosneft, so it will have to pay real money to the creditors to avoid seizure of Yugansk assets,\" said Moscow-based US lawyer Jamie Firestone, who is not connected to the case.

But the company has said it intends to take action against Menatep to recover some of the tax claims and debts owed by Yugansk. Yukos had filed for bankruptcy protection in a US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. The sale went ahead in December and Yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft.

Its brands, well-known in Italy and overseas, have continued to perform strongly, however, and have barely lost revenue since the scandal broke.\\n\\nBut a crucial factor for the company's future is the legal unwinding of its intensely complex financial position. On Tuesday, the company's administrator, turnaround expert Enrico Bondi, sued Morgan Stanley, its former banker, to return 136m euros relating to a 2003 bond deal. That brought to 49 the number of banks that Mr Bondi has sued, a mass of legal action that could bring in as much as 3bn euros.

       " \"Arsenal through on penalties\\n\\nArsenal win 4-2 on penalties\\n\\nThe Spanish goalkeeper saved from Alan Quinn and Jon Harley as Arsenal sealed a quarter-final trip to Bolton with a 4-2 victory on penalties. Lauren, Patrick Vieira, Freddie Ljungberg and Ashley Cole scored for Arsenal, while Andy Gray and Phil Jagielka were on target for the Blades. Michael Tonge and Harley wasted chances for the underdogs, but Paddy Kenny was inspired to keep Arsenal at bay. Arsenal, stripped of attacking talent such as Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp, partnered 17-year-old Italian striker Arturo Lupoli with Ljungberg up front. It was a revamped Arsenal line-up, and they were almost a goal behind within seconds as Tonge wasted a glorious chance. Gray ran free down the right flank, and his cross left Tonge with the simplest of chances, but he blazed over the top from six yards.\\n\\nArsenal were barely seen as an attacking force in the opening 45 minutes, although Ljungberg turned a half-chance wide after good work by Cesc Fabregas. Arsene Wenger introduced Quincy Owusu-Abeyie for the ineffective Lupoli at half-time, and the pacy Dutch youngster had an immediate impact. He ran clear after good work by Mathieu Flamini, but his finish was tame and Kenny saved easily. Owusu-Abeyie then fired in a testing cross, which was met by Fabregas, and it needed a desperate clearance by Kenny's legs to save the Blades. Arsenal were now totally dominant, and were desperately unlucky not to take the lead after 62 minutes when Fabregas crashed a rising drive against the bar from 20 yards. It then took a brilliant tackle by Jagielka to deny Ljungberg as he was poised to strike. Arsenal continued to press, and once again Kenny was called into action with eight minutes left, diving low to clutch another close-range effort from Fabregas. Neil Warnock's side almost snatched victory in the dying seconds when Derek Geary's cross found Harley at the far post, but his diving header was brilliantly turned over by Almunia. Owusu-Abeyie's pace was causing all sorts of problems for the Blades, and as extra-time began, another surging run into the penalty area almost set up a chance for Ljungberg. Pascal Cygan missed Arsenal's best chance after 106 minutes, blazing across the face of goal when he was unmarked at the far post. Arsenal sent on Jeremie Aliadiere with seven minutes of extra-time left, and he almost broke the deadlock with his first touch. Kolo Toure's misplaced free-kick landed at his feet, but Kenny once again blocked from a tight angle. Arsenal laid siege to Sheffield United's goal in the dying minutes, but they somehow held on to force penalties. Almunia was then Arsenal's hero as another brave Blades cup campaign came to a losing end.\\n\\nKenny, Geary, Morgan, Bromby, Harley, Liddell, Montgomery, Jagielka, Thirlwell, Tonge (Quinn 97), Gray.\\n\\nSubs Not Used: Francis, Kabba, Shaw, Haystead.\\n\\nMorgan.\\n\\nAlmunia, Lauren, Cygan, Senderos, Cole, Fabregas (Toure 90), Vieira, Flamini (Aliadiere 113), Clichy, Lupoli (Owusu-Abeyie 45), Ljungberg.\\n\\nSubs Not Used: Eboue, Taylor.\\n\\nClichy, Lauren, Senderos.\\n\\n27,595\\n\\nP Dowd (Staffordshire).\\n\",\n",
       " 'Cole faces lengthy injury lay-off\\n\\nAston Villa\\'s Carlton Cole could be out for six weeks with a knee injury.\\n\\nThe striker, who is on a season-long loan from Chelsea, picked up the knock in an England Under-21 match against Holland earlier this month. \"Carlton will be out of action for four to six weeks after a bad challenge,\" said Villa boss David O\\'Leary. \"I won\\'t be able to tell you whether he will need an operation until maybe next week. Whether he has an operation has got to be left to Chelsea.\" Cole, who also struggled with an ankle problem earlier in the season, was unable to rest because O\\'Leary had a shortage of strikers. The return to fitness of Darius Vassell after four months out with a broken ankle and the emergence of Luke Moore has alleviated some of the Villa\\'s manager\\'s problems in that department.\\n',\n",

And Keegan believes there is still more to come from the former England forward. \"He can get better if we can supply him better,\" added Keegan. \"People want to write him off but if he has kept the articles of those people who have written him off he could throw them back at them and they would be left with a bit of egg on their face.\" Fowler\\'s double strike helped City come back from two goals down to clinch a dramatic win at Carrow Road and Keegan sympathised with Norwich boss Nigel Worthington afterwards. \"I feel a bit for Nigel Worthington,\" he said. \"His team have got great character, they have a lot of drive and enthusiasm. \"I know it is a killer blow for Norwich but I really think they have brought something to the Premiership. \"The stadium and the atmosphere is great, it is just a tough league to stay in - as they are finding out and as we know.\"\\n',\n",

The 26-year-old has already handed in a transfer request at Ewood Park as he seeks a return to Ibrox. But the clubs have been unable to reach agreement over a fee for Ferguson, who moved to Lancashire in 2003 for Â£6.5m. On Thursday Rangers said they would not be increasing their offer of Â£4m.\\n\\nBlackburn have said all along that they want Â£6m for the midfielder and Williams has rejected proposals from Rangers over a player-swap deal. Williams said: \"We are in dialogue with Glasgow Rangers but we have no agreement.\" The negotiations will have to be concluded by midnight on Monday, when the winter transfer window shuts. Williams conceded any deal for Ferguson was looking \"unlikely\" before the close of the transfer window but Rangers still had a chance to seal the deal. \"We have no comment to make other than we have not got an agreement with Glasgow Rangers,\" he added. \"The way things are looking, I think it is unlikely we are going to. \"The ball is in their court but we have not got an offer that is acceptable at this moment.\" It is understood that Blackburn accepted a Â£5m offer for Ferguson from Everton at the weekend. But the player is determined to return to Scotland and rejected a move to Goodison Park. Ferguson did not play in the FA Cup win over Colchester on Saturday despite recovering from a groin injury with Rovers boss Mark Hughes claiming it had been an \"emotional and difficult time\" for the player.\\n',\n",
       " 'China keeps tight rein on credit\\n\\nChina\\'s efforts to stop the economy from overheating by clamping down on credit will continue into 2005, state media report.\\n\\nThe curbs were introduced earlier this year to ward off the risk that rapid expansion might lead to soaring prices. There were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system. Growth in China remains at a breakneck 9.1%, and corporate investment is growing at more than 25% a year. The breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above 9% for more than a year. Rapid tooling-up of China\\'s manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the factors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year. In theory, the government has a 7% growth target, but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a \"hard landing\" in the shape of an overbalancing economy. A low exchange rate - China\\'s yuan is pegged to a rate of 8.28 to the dollar, which seems to be in relentless decline - means Chinese exports are cheap on world markets. China has thus far resisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift the level of its peg. To some extent, the credit controls do seem to be taking effect. Industrial output grew 15.7% in the year to October, down from 23% in February, and inflation slowed to 4.3% - although retail sales are still booming.\\n',\n",
       " 'Dollar gains on Greenspan speech\\n\\nThe dollar has hit its highest level against the euro in almost three months after the Federal Reserve head said the US trade deficit is set to stabilise.\\n\\nAnd Alan Greenspan highlighted the US government\\'s willingness to curb spending and rising household savings as factors which may help to reduce it. In late trading in New York, the dollar reached $1.2871 against the euro, from $1.2974 on Thursday. Market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months. On Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Mr Greenspan\\'s speech in London ahead of the meeting of G7 finance ministers sent the dollar higher after it had earlier tumbled on the back of worse-than-expected US jobs data. \"I think the chairman\\'s taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he\\'s taken for some time,\" said Robert Sinche, head of currency strategy at Bank of America in New York. \"He\\'s taking a longer-term view, laying out a set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next.\"\\n\\nWorries about the deficit concerns about China do, however, remain. China\\'s currency remains pegged to the dollar and the US currency\\'s sharp falls in recent months have therefore made Chinese export prices highly competitive. But calls for a shift in Beijing\\'s policy have fallen on deaf ears, despite recent comments in a major Chinese newspaper that the \"time is ripe\" for a loosening of the peg. The G7 meeting is thought unlikely to produce any meaningful movement in Chinese policy. In the meantime, the US Federal Reserve\\'s decision on 2 February to boost interest rates by a quarter of a point - the sixth such move in as many months - has opened up a differential with European rates. The half-point window, some believe, could be enough to keep US assets looking more attractive, and could help prop up the dollar. The recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits, as well as the US\\'s yawning current account gap, both of which need to be funded by the buying of US bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments. The White House will announce its budget on Monday, and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half a trillion dollars.\\n',\n",
       " 'More power to the people says HP\\n\\nThe digital revolution is focused on letting people tell and share their own stories, according to Carly Fiorina, chief of technology giant Hewlett Packard.\\n\\nThe job of firms such as HP now, she said in a speech at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), was to ensure digital and physical worlds fully converged. She said the goal for 2005 was to make people the centre of technology. CES showcases 50,000 new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in 2005. The tech-fest, the largest of its kind in the world, runs from 6 to 9 January. \"The digital revolution is about the democratisation of technology and the experiences it makes possible,\" she told delegates. \"Revolution has always been about giving power to the people.\" She added: \"The real story of the digital revolution is not just new products, but the millions of experiences made possible and stories that millions can tell.\" Part of giving people more control has been about the freeing up of content, such as images, video and music. Crucial to this has been the effort to make devices that speak to each other better so that content can be more easily transferred from one device, such as a digital camera, to others, such as portable media players. A lot of work still needs to be done, however, to sort out compatibility issues and standards within the technology industry so that gadgets just work seamlessly, she said.\\n\\nMs Fiorina\\'s talk also touted the way technology is being designed to focus on lifestyle, fashion and personalisation, something she sees as key to what people want.\\n\\nSpecial guest, singer Gwen Stefani, joined her on-stage to promote her own range of HP digital cameras which Ms Stefani has helped design and which are heavily influenced by Japanese youth culture. The digital cameras, which are due to go on sale in the US by the summer, are based on the HP 607 model. The emphasis on personalisation and lifestyle is a big theme at this year\\'s CES, with tiny, wearable MP3 players at every turn and rainbow hues giving colour to everything. Ms Fiorina also announced that HP was working with Nokia to launch a visual radio service for mobiles, which would launch in Europe early this year. The service will let people listen to radio on their mobiles and download relevant content, like a track\\'s ringtone, simultaneously. The service is designed to make mobile radio more interactive.\\n\\nAmong the other new products she showcased was the Digital Media Hub, a big upgrade to HP\\'s Digital Entertainment Centre. Coming out in the autumn in the US, the box is a networked, high-definition TV, cable set-top box, digital video recorder and DVD recorder. It has a removable hard drive cartridge, memory card slots, and Light Scribe labelling software which lets people design and print customised DVD labels and covers. It is designed to contain all a household\\'s digital media, such as pre-recorded TV shows, pictures, videos and music so it can all be managed in one place. The hub reflects the increasing move to re-box the PC so that it can work as part of other key centres of entertainment. Research suggests that about 258 million images are saved and shared every day, equating to 94 billion a year. Eighty per cent of those remain on cameras. Media hubs are designed to encourage people to organise them on one box. Ms Fiorina was one of several keynote speakers, who also included Microsoft chief Bill Gates, to set out what major technology companies think people will be doing with technologies and gadgets in the next 12 months. In a separate announcement during the keynote speech, Ms Fiorina said that HP would be partnering MTV to replace this year\\'s MTV Asia music award. MTV\\'s Asia Aid will be held in Bangkok on 3 February, and is aimed at helping to raise money for the Asian tsunami disaster.\\n',\n",
       " 'Anti-spam screensaver scrapped\\n\\nA contentious campaign to bump up the bandwidth bills of spammers by flooding their sites with data has been dropped.\\n\\nLycos Europe\\'s Make Love, Not Spam campaign began in late November but its tactics proved controversial. Lycos has shut down the campaign saying it had been started to stimulate debate about anti-spam measures and had now achieved this aim. The anti-spammer screensaver came under fire for encouraging vigilante activity and skirting the edge of the law.\\n\\nThrough the Make Love, Not Spam website, users could download a screensaver that would endlessly request data from the net sites mentioned in many junk mail messages. More than 100,000 people are thought to have downloaded the screensaver that Lycos Europe offered.\\n\\nThe company wanted to keep the spam sites running at near total capacity to make it much less financially attractive to spammers to operate the sites. But the campaign was controversial from the moment it kicked off and many net veterans criticised it for using spamming-type tactics against the senders of junk mail. Some net service firms began blocking access to the Lycos Europe site in protest at the action. Monitoring firm Netcraft found that the anti-spam campaign was proving a little too successful. According to response-time figures gathered by Netcraft, some of the sites that the screensaver targeted were being knocked offline by the constant data requests. In a statement from Lycos Europe announcing the scrapping of the scheme, the company denied that this was its fault. \"There is nothing to suggest that Make Love, Not Spam has brought down any of the sites that it has targeted,\" it said. \"At the time that Netcraft measured the sites it claims may have been brought down, they were not in fact part of the Make Love, Not Spam attack cycle,\" it added. The statement issued by Lycos also said that the centralised database it used ensured that traffic to the target sites left them with 5% spare capacity. \"The idea was simply to slow spammers\\' sites and this was achieved by the campaign,\" the company said. Many security organisations said users should not participate in the Lycos Europe campaign. The closure comes only days after the campaign was suspended following the outbreak of criticism.\\n',\n",
       " 'Ferguson urges Henry punishment\\n\\nSir Alex Ferguson has called on the Football Association to punish Arsenal\\'s Thierry Henry for an incident involving Gabriel Heinze.\\n\\nFerguson believes Henry deliberately caught Heinze on the head with his knee during United\\'s controversial win. The United boss said it was worse than Ruud van Nistelrooy\\'s foul on Ashley Cole for which he got a three-game ban. \"We shall present it to the FA and see what they do. The tackle on Heinze was terrible,\" he said. Clubs are permitted to ask the FA to examine specific incidents but information is expected to be provided within 48 hours of the game. The clash occurred moments before half-time when a Freddie Ljungberg challenge left Heinze on the ground on the left touchline. Henry, following the ball, attempted to hurdle the Argentine but his knee collided with the back of Heinze\\'s head.\\n\\nThe striker protested his innocence - and referee Mike Riley deemed the collision accidental. Ferguson was also upset by Arsenal\\'s overall discipline during the heated encounter between the two arch-rivals and praised his own side\\'s behaviour. \"Edu produced a terrible tackle on Scholes that was a potential leg-breaker,\" he said. \"There were 24 fouls in the game by Arsenal, seven on Heinze, five on Ronaldo, six by Vieira - and it was only his sixth foul that got him booked. Phil Neville got booked for his first challenge. \"I am proud of my players for the way they handled that pressure. \"We have always been good at being gracious in defeat. What happened on Sunday overshadowed our achievement, but then they do it all the time, don\\'t they?\"\\n',\n",
       " 'TV future in the hands of viewers\\n\\nWith home theatre systems, plasma high-definition TVs, and digital video recorders moving into the living room, the way people watch TV will be radically different in five years\\' time.\\n\\nThat is according to an expert panel which gathered at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas to discuss how these new technologies will impact one of our favourite pastimes. With the US leading the trend, programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks, through cable, satellite, telecoms companies, and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices.\\n\\nOne of the most talked-about technologies of CES has been digital and personal video recorders (DVR and PVR). These set-top boxes, like the US\\'s TiVo and the UK\\'s Sky+ system, allow people to record, store, play, pause and forward wind TV programmes when they want.\\n\\nEssentially, the technology allows for much more personalised TV. They are also being built-in to high-definition TV sets, which are big business in Japan and the US, but slower to take off in Europe because of the lack of high-definition programming. Not only can people forward wind through adverts, they can also forget about abiding by network and channel schedules, putting together their own a-la-carte entertainment. But some US networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as \"brand identity\" and viewer loyalty to channels. Although the US leads in this technology at the moment, it is also a concern that is being raised in Europe, particularly with the growing uptake of services like Sky+. \"What happens here today, we will see in nine months to a years\\' time in the UK,\" Adam Hume, the BBC Broadcast\\'s futurologist told the BBC News website. For the likes of the BBC, there are no issues of lost advertising revenue yet. It is a more pressing issue at the moment for commercial UK broadcasters, but brand loyalty is important for everyone. \"We will be talking more about content brands rather than network brands,\" said Tim Hanlon, from brand communications firm Starcom MediaVest. \"The reality is that with broadband connections, anybody can be the producer of content.\" He added: \"The challenge now is that it is hard to promote a programme with so much choice.\"\\n\\nWhat this means, said Stacey Jolna, senior vice president of TV Guide TV group, is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for TV viewers. It means that networks, in US terms, or channels could take a leaf out of Google\\'s book and be the search engine of the future, instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch. This kind of channel model might work for the younger iPod generation which is used to taking control of their gadgets and what they play on them. But it might not suit everyone, the panel recognised. Older generations are more comfortable with familiar schedules and channel brands because they know what they are getting. They perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands, Mr Hanlon suggested. \"On the other end, you have the kids just out of diapers who are pushing buttons already - everything is possible and available to them,\" said Mr Hanlon. \"Ultimately, the consumer will tell the market they want.\"\\n\\nOf the 50,000 new gadgets and technologies being showcased at CES, many of them are about enhancing the TV-watching experience. High-definition TV sets are everywhere and many new models of LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) TVs have been launched with DVR capability built into them, instead of being external boxes. One such example launched at the show is Humax\\'s 26-inch LCD TV with an 80-hour TiVo DVR and DVD recorder. One of the US\\'s biggest satellite TV companies, DirectTV, has even launched its own branded DVR at the show with 100-hours of recording capability, instant replay, and a search function. The set can pause and rewind TV for up to 90 hours. And Microsoft chief Bill Gates announced in his pre-show keynote speech a partnership with TiVo, called TiVoToGo, which means people can play recorded programmes on Windows PCs and mobile devices. All these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want, when they want.\\n',\n",
       " 'Remote control rifle range debuts\\n\\nSoon you could go hunting via the net.\\n\\nA Texas company is considering letting web users use a remote-controlled rifle to shoot down deer, antelope and wild pigs. For a small fee users will take control of a camera and rifle that they can use to spot and shoot the game animals as they roam around a 133-hectare Texas ranch. The Live-Shot website behind the scheme already lets people practise shooting at targets via the internet.\\n\\nJohn Underwood, the man behind the Live-Shot website, said the idea for the remote-control hunting came to him a year ago when he was watching deer via a webcam on another net site. \"We were looking at a beautiful white-tail buck and my friend said \\'If you just had a gun for that\\'. A little light bulb went off in my head,\" Mr Underwood told the Reuters news agency. A year\\'s work and $10,000 has resulted in a remote-controlled rig on which sits a camera and .22 calibre rifle. Mr Underwood is planning to put one of these rigs in a concealed location in a small reserve on his Texas ranch and let people shoot at a variety of game animals. Also needed is a fast net connection so remote hunters can quickly track and aim at passing game animals with the camera and rifle rig. Each remote hunting session will cost $150 with additional fees for meat processing and taxidermy work. Species that can be shot will include barbary, Corsican and mouflon sheep, blackbuck antelope and wild pigs. Already the Live-Shot site lets people shoot 10 rounds at paper and silhouette targets for $5.95 for each 20-minute shooting session. For further fees, users can get the target they shot and a DVD recording of their session. Handlers oversee each shooting session and can stop the gun being fired if it is being aimed off-range or at something it should not be. Mr Underwood said that internet hunting could be popular with disabled hunters unable to get out in the woods or distant hunters who cannot afford a trip to Texas. In a statement the RSPCA said it had \"grave concerns\" about people being allowed to go online and remotely control a rifle. \"We assume it would be extremely difficult to accurately control a gun in this way and therefore it would be difficult to ensure a \\'clean kill\\', something the RSPCA accepts is the intention of those shooting for sport,\" it said. \"Animals hit but not killed would without doubt be caused to suffer unnecessarily,\" said the statement. Mike Berger, wildlife director of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, said current hunting statutes did not cover net or remote hunting. He said state laws on hunting only covered \"regulated animals\" such as native deer and bird species. As such there was nothing to stop Mr Underwood letting people hunt \"unregulated\" imported animals and wild pigs. Mr Underwood also lets people come in person to the ranch to hunt and shoot game animals.\\n',\n",

Journalists at the firm met on Friday afternoon to discuss how to react to the surprise announcement. The cuts come against a background of fierce competition for readers and sluggish advertising revenues amid competition from online advertising. The National Union of Journalists has called on the management to recall the notice of redundancy by midday on Monday or face a strike ballot.\\n\\nPearson\\'s Financial Times said last week it was offering voluntary redundancy to about 30 reporters.\\n\\nThe National Union of Journalists said it stood strongly behind the journalists and did not rule out a strike. \"Managers have torn up agreed procedures and kicked staff in the teeth by sacking people to pay for printing facilities,\" said Jeremy Dear, NUJ General Secretary. NUJ official Barry Fitzpatrick said the company had ignored the 90-day consultation period required for companies planning more than 10 redundancies. \"They have shown a complete disregard for the consultative rights of our members,\" said Mr Fitzpatrick, who added that the company now planned to observe the consultation procedures. The two Telegraph titles currently employ 521 journalists.\\n\\nSome broadsheet newspapers - especially those which have not moved to a tabloid format - have suffered circulation declines, which are hitting revenues. The Telegraph has announced no plans to go tabloid although both The Independent and The Times have seen circulation rise since shrinking in size.\\n\\nThe Guardian is hedging its bets, planning a larger tabloid format like those popular in continental Europe. The Telegraph Group was bought by the Barclay twins - Frederick and David - last year, having previously been owned by Lord Conrad Black\\'s Hollinger International. The brothers are currently mulling the sale of another of their businesses, retailer Littlewoods.\\n\\nTelegraph executive Murdoch MacLennan said the two newspapers would add eight colour pages in the coming months.\\n\\n\"Journalists are the lifeblood of any newspaper, and maintaining the quality of The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph for our readers is vital,\" he said. \"However, action to improve our production capability and secure our titles against the competition is also vital.\" Many newspapers are investing in new printing machinery that enables them to print more colour pages, or in some cases, have colour on every page. They are hoping that by boosting colour it will make their publications more attractive to advertisers and readers alike.

The IEA raised its estimate of 2005 oil demand growth by 80,000 barrels a day to 84 million barrels a day. US light crude rose $1.64 to $47.10, while Brent crude in London gained $1.32 to $44.45.\\n\\nThe Paris-based IEA watchdog, which advises industrialized nations on energy policy, said the upward revision was due to stronger demand from China and other Asian countries. The fresh rally in crude prices followed gains on Wednesday which were triggered by large falls in US crude supplies following a cold spell in North America in January. The US Department of Energy reported that crude stockpiles had fallen 1m barrels to 294.3m. On top of that, ongoing problems for beleaguered Russian oil giant Yukos have also prompted the IEA to revise its output estimates from Russia - a major non-Opec supplier. \"I think that prices are now beginning to set a new range and it looks like the $40 to $50 level,\" said energy analyst Orin Middleton of Barclays Capital.\\n',\n",

Hodgson is a fierce advocate of the winter break employed throughout Europe, although not in England - where the Champions League contenders have ploughed through a heavy fixture list. But Hodgson told BBC Sport that while he believes the Premiership should embrace the idea, he does not expect it to cost the English representatives in the last 16 of the Champions League. \"I just feel it is very difficult to say with certainty that teams who have had the break will have a definite edge. \"I am a fervent supporter of the break. It gives players the chance to recharge their batteries midway through the season, which some suggest will give teams an advantage in the Champions League. \"The other school of thought suggests having a break then coming back to it puts you at a disadvantage. \"The bigger discussions around the winter break should be to do with the nature of football today, the needs of football players and the way the Premiership has developed, rather than one or two matches in the Champions League in February.\" Hodgson believes a winter break carries many advantages, explaining: \"As I said, it is the perfect chance to recharge batteries.\\n\\n\"And certainly if I was still a manager in England I would be supporting any calls for its introduction. \"In pre-season you get a lot of enthusiasm and energy but by the time you get towards Christmas many players, having also played plenty of international matches for club and country and travelled a lot, find themselves getting very jaded. \"The break gives them a chance to recover that energy and enthusiasm and, perhaps more importantly, recover their mental strength during the break and get ready for the games ahead. \"The mental side is by far the most important thing.\" Hodgson added: \"The length of breaks can vary. In Italy the break was very short. You just took Christmas and New Year. \"It was so short you didn\\'t do anything. You gave the players a week or 10 days off, then you were training for a week or 10 days and then went into a game. \"If it is longer, it is important those responsible for physical fitness give the players a programme to follow to ensure the physical strength they have accumulated stays with them.\" And Hodgson believes a winter break would be a positive step in the Premiership. He said: \"If we talk about football at elite level, which the Premiership is, then I would support a winter break. \"If you examine the demands of the Premier League and, in particular on players who play international football for their club and country, then a break would do them the world of good - physically and mentally.\"\\n',\n",

The votes were later counted towards that month\\'s English local elections. The men, elected to the Aston ward, deny collecting votes fraudulently. The judge presiding has indicated the whole postal voting system is under scrutiny. Deputy High Court Judge Richard Mawrey, QC told the hearing at the Birmingham and Midlands Institute the case could have potentially serious consequences for any forthcoming General Election.\\n\\nThe special Election Court, the first in living memory to hear allegations of vote-rigging, opened in Birmingham last month. The case against Muhammad Afzal, Mohammed Islam and Mohammed Kazi is being brought by local Liberal Democrat supporters. They claim the trio benefited from the widespread misuse of postal votes during the 10 June election. Ravi Sukul, counsel for the petitioners, accused the three men of being \"deeply involved\" in illegal practices. Witnesses saw them carrying several bags from their campaign office, which the men drove to a warehouse on an industrial estate off Birch Road East, the court was told.\\n\\nThe police were alerted and called to the premises. Mr Sukul said: \"When (the officers) arrived there, in the middle of the night, they saw a large room with a 10ft long table and six Asian men present. \"Hundreds of documents and unsealed envelopes were scattered all over the table.\" The police officers left the warehouse, but were later ordered back to seize the documents. \"When the officers left, all the envelopes and papers were scattered,\" Mr Sukul said.\\n\\n\"(When they went) back to make the seizure, every one of these 275 yellow ballot papers were placed neatly in envelope A and sealed.

       " 'Blair returns from peace mission\\n\\nPrime Minister Tony Blair has arrived back from his diplomatic mission to the Middle East to try to resurrect the peace process.\\n\\nMr Blair held talks with his Israeli counterpart, Ariel Sharon, and the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas. He confirmed that a renewed drive to reform the Palestinian Authority and address security issues would come at a London conference in March. Mr Blair also made a surprise trip to Iraq this week. The Israelis described the meeting as important but said they would not need to attend. Mr Blair briefly visited the tomb of Yasser Arafat in Ramallah - the first world leader to do so. He nodded briefly towards the tomb, rather than lay a wreath, in what Palestinian officials said was a compromise gesture agreed at the last minute.\\n\\nThe BBC\\'s Paul Reynolds says the London conference will be a limited measure to shore up the leadership of Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, who is expected to win the Palestinian presidential election on 9 January. At a news conference following talks with Mr Blair, Mr Abbas said the British prime minister was \"in a unique position to help us progress in our peaceful pursuit\". He added: \"Your endeavour to hold a conference in London is another example of your deep commitment to this purpose.\" In an interview with the BBC\\'s political editor Andrew Marr, Mr Blair said getting progress between Israelis and Palestinians would be \"tough, but at least we have got the first step\". Mr Blair acknowledged some people believed he was too close to the Israelis, but said the Israelis were entitled to expect Palestinians to give up terrorism. He argued that Mr Sharon was committed to the internationally-agreed roadmap peace plan and said his bid to disengage from Gaza had to be part of the peace process, not the end of it. Earlier, Mr Sharon again said he had not seen \"the slightest step\" the Palestinians were working to end terror attacks - though he acknowledged Palestinian leaders were in the middle of an election campaign that could be hampering their efforts. Before visiting Israel, Mr Blair made a surprise visit to Iraq, where he met leaders in Baghdad during his first trip to the city. He was briefed on preparations for the national poll, which is scheduled for next month but is threatened by a deadly campaign of insurgent violence. He also flew to Basra in southern Iraq where British forces are stationed.\\n',\n",

He was on a night out with his girlfriend and two friends following Everton\\'s 3-1 win over Aston Villa. \"He was shaken but not badly injured,\" said Everton spokesman Ian Ross.

Former assistant Antonio Lopez will take over as the new coach. Italian Ranieri took over the Valencia job in June 2004 having been replaced at Chelsea by Jose Mourinho.\\n\\nThings began well but the Spanish champions extended their winless streak to six after losing to Racing Santander last weekend. That defeat was then followed by a Uefa Cup exit at the hands of Steaua Bucharest. Ranieri first took charge of Valencia in 1997, guiding them to the King\\'s Cup and helping them to qualify for the Champions League. The 54-year-old then moved to Atletico Madrid in 1999, before joining Chelsea the following year.\\n',\n",

The government is cracking down on so-called latifundios, or large rural estates, which it says are lying idle. The Vestey Group said it had not been informed of any planned seizure.\\n\\nThe firm, whose Agroflora subsidiary operates 13 farms in Venezuela, insisted that it had complied fully with Venezuelan law. Prosecutors in the south of the country have targeted Hato El Charcote, a beef cattle ranch owned by Agroflora. According to Reuters, they plan to seize 12,900 acres (5,200 hectares) from the 32,000 acre (13,000 hectare) farm.\\n\\nOfficials claim that Agroflora does not possess valid documents proving its ownership of the land in question. They also allege that areas of the ranch are not being used for any form of active production. \"The legal boundaries did not match up with the actual boundaries and there is surplus,\" state prosecutor Alexis Ortiz told Reuters. \"As a consequence the government has taken action.\"\\n\\nControversial reforms passed in 2001 give the government the right to take control of private property if it is declared idle or ownership cannot be traced back to the 19th Century.\\n\\nCritics say the powers - which President Chavez argues are needed to help the country\\'s poorest citizens and develop the Venezuelan economy - trample all over private property rights. The Vestey Group said it had owned the land since 1920 and would co-operate fully with the authorities. But a spokesman added: \"Agroflora is absolutely confident that what it has submitted will demonstrate the legality of its title to the land.\" The company pointed out that the farm, which employs 300 workers, provides meat solely for the Venezuelan market.\\n\\nLast month, the government said it had identified more than 500 idle farms and had yet to consider the status of a further 40,000. The authorities said landowners whose titles were in order and whose farms were productive had \"nothing to fear\". Under President Chavez, the Venezuelan government has steadily expanded the state\\'s involvement in the country\\'s economy. It recently said all mining contracts involving foreign firms would be examined to ensure they provided sufficient economic benefits to the state.\\n',\n",
       " 'Ad sales boost Time Warner profit\\n\\nQuarterly profits at US media giant TimeWarner jumped 76% to $1.13bn (Â£600m) for the three months to December, from $639m year-earlier.\\n\\nThe firm, which is now one of the biggest investors in Google, benefited from sales of high-speed internet connections and higher advert sales. TimeWarner said fourth quarter sales rose 2% to $11.1bn from $10.9bn. Its profits were buoyed by one-off gains which offset a profit dip at Warner Bros, and less users for AOL.\\n\\nTime Warner said on Friday that it now owns 8% of search-engine Google. But its own internet business, AOL, had has mixed fortunes. It lost 464,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter profits were lower than in the preceding three quarters. However, the company said AOL\\'s underlying profit before exceptional items rose 8% on the back of stronger internet advertising revenues. It hopes to increase subscribers by offering the online service free to TimeWarner internet customers and will try to sign up AOL\\'s existing customers for high-speed broadband. TimeWarner also has to restate 2000 and 2003 results following a probe by the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), which is close to concluding.\\n\\nTime Warner\\'s fourth quarter profits were slightly better than analysts\\' expectations. But its film division saw profits slump 27% to $284m, helped by box-office flops Alexander and Catwoman, a sharp contrast to year-earlier, when the third and final film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy boosted results. For the full-year, TimeWarner posted a profit of $3.36bn, up 27% from its 2003 performance, while revenues grew 6.4% to $42.09bn. \"Our financial performance was strong, meeting or exceeding all of our full-year objectives and greatly enhancing our flexibility,\" chairman and chief executive Richard Parsons said. For 2005, TimeWarner is projecting operating earnings growth of around 5%, and also expects higher revenue and wider profit margins.\\n\\nTimeWarner is to restate its accounts as part of efforts to resolve an inquiry into AOL by US market regulators. It has already offered to pay $300m to settle charges, in a deal that is under review by the SEC. The company said it was unable to estimate the amount it needed to set aside for legal reserves, which it previously set at $500m. It intends to adjust the way it accounts for a deal with German music publisher Bertelsmann\\'s purchase of a stake in AOL Europe, which it had reported as advertising revenue. It will now book the sale of its stake in AOL Europe as a loss on the value of that stake.\\n',\n",
       " 'Air passengers win new EU rights\\n\\nAir passengers who are unable to board their flights because of overbooking, cancellations or flight delays can now demand greater compensation.\\n\\nNew EU rules set compensation at between 250 euros (Â£173) and 600 euros, depending on the length of the flight. The new rules will apply to all scheduled and charter flights, including budget airlines. Airlines have attacked the legislation saying they could be forced to push prices higher to cover the extra cost. The European Commission is facing two legal challenges - one from the European Low-fare Airlines Association (ELAA) and the other from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which has attacked the package as a \"bad piece of legislation\". Previously, passengers could claim between 150 euros and 300 euros if they had been stopped from boarding.\\n\\nHowever, only scheduled flight operators were obliged to offer compensation in cases of overbooking and they did not have to offer compensation for flight cancellations.\\n\\nThe EU decided to increase passenger compensation in a bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights. Overbooking can often lead to \\'bumping\\' - when a passenger is moved to a later flight. When this happens against a passenger\\'s will, airlines will now have to offer compensation. In addition, if a flight is cancelled or delayed for more than two hours through the fault of the airline, all passengers must be paid compensation.\\n\\nHowever, airlines do not have to offer compensation if flights are cancelled or delayed due to \"extraordinary circumstances\". Airlines fear that \"extraordinary circumstances\" may not include bad weather, security alerts or strikes - events which are outside of their control. All EU-based airlines and operators of flights which take off from the EU will have to adhere to the new compensation regime which came into force on Thursday. Low-cost airlines have criticised the new compensation levels, arguing that the pay-out could be worth more than the ticket. \"It\\'s a preposterous piece of legislation, we among all airlines are fighting this,\" Ryanair deputy chief executive Michael Cawley told Radio 4\\'s Today programme.\\n\\nThe European Regions Airline Association (ERAA) claims that neither airlines nor consumers were consulted over the changes. Andy Clarke, ERAA director of air transport, said that the EC advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather.\\n\\nEC spokeswoman Marja Quillinan-Meiland conceded there were \"grey areas\" but said \"these are not as big as the airlines are making out\". In cases of dispute, national enforcement bodies would decide whether the passenger had a case, she said. New technology means it is easier for airlines to take off and land in bad weather, she added. The ERAA\\'s Mr Clarke also warned that while airlines would comply with the new rules, the extra costs would be passed onto passengers. \"We reckon it\\'s going to cost European air passengers - not the airlines, the airlines have no money, it has to be paid by passengers - 1.5bn euros, that\\'s over Â£1bn a year loaded onto European passengers,\" Mr Clarke said. \"That\\'s basically a transfer of money from passengers whose journeys are not disrupted to passengers whose journeys are disrupted.\"\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Jacques Barrot, vice president of the European Commission and also Commissioner for Transport, said that the changes were necessary. \"The boom in air travel needs to be accompanied by proper protection of passengers\\' right.\" \"This is a concrete example of how the Union benefits people\\'s daily lives,\" he added. The EC has launched an information campaign in airports and travel agencies to inform airline passengers of their new rights.\\n',\n",
       " 'Gangsters dominate gaming chart\\n\\nVideo games on consoles and computers proved more popular than ever in 2004.\\n\\nGamers spent more than Â£1.34bn in 2004, almost 7% more than they did in 2003 according to figures released by the UK gaming industry\\'s trade body. Sales records were smashed by the top title of the year GTA: San Andreas - in which players got the job of turning central character CJ into a crime boss. The game sold more than 1 million copies in the first nine days that it was on sale. This feat made it the fastest selling video game of all time in the UK. Although only released in November the sprawling story of guns, gangsters game beat off strong competition and by year end had sold more than 1.75 million copies. There were also records set for the number of games that achieved double-platinum status by selling more than 600,000 copies. Five titles, including Sony EyeToy Play and EA\\'s Need for Speed: Underground 2, managed this feat according to figures compiled by Chart-Track for the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (Elspa). Electronic Arts, the world\\'s biggest games publisher, had 9 games in the top 20.\\n\\n2004 was a \"stellar year\" said Roger Bennett, director general of Elspa. \"In a year with no new generation consoles being released, the market continued to be buoyant as the industry matured and the increasingly diverse range of games reached new audiences and broadened its player base - across ages and gender,\" he said. Part of the success of games in 2004 could be due to the fact that so many of them are sequels. 16 out of the top 20 titles were all follow-ups to established franchises or direct sequels to previously popular games. Halo, The Sims, Driver, Need for Speed, Fifa football, Burnout were just a few that proved as popular as the original titles. Despite this fondness for older games, Doom 3 did not make it to the top 20. Movie tie-ins also proved their worth in 2004. Games linked to Shrek, The Incredibles, Spider-Man, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings were all in the top 20. Elspa noted that sales of Xbox games rose 37.9% during the year. However, Sony\\'s PlayStation 2 was the top seller with 47% of the Â£1.34bn spent on games in 2004 used to buy titles for that console. Despite winning awards and rave reviews Half-Life 2 did not appear in the list. This was because it was only released on PC and, compared to console titles, sold in relatively small numbers. Also the novel distribution system adopted by developer Valve meant that many players downloaded the title rather than travel to the shops to buy a copy. Valve has yet to release figures which show how many copies of the game were sold in this way.\\n',\n",
       " 'Cyber criminals step up the pace\\n\\nSo-called phishing attacks that try to trick people into handing over confidential details have boomed in 2004, say security experts.\\n\\nThe number of phishing e-mail messages stopped by security firm MessageLabs has risen more than tenfold in less than 12 months. In 2004 it detected more than 18 million phishing e-mail messages. Other statistics show that in 2004 73% of all e-mail was spam and one in 16 messages were infected with a virus.\\n\\nIn its end-of-year report, MessageLabs said that phishing had become the top security threat and most popular form of attack among cyber criminals. In September 2003, MessageLabs caught only 273 phishing e-mails that tried to make people visit fake versions of the websites run by real banks and financial organisations. But by September 2004 it was stopping more than two million phishing related e-mail messages per month. Worryingly, said the firm, phishing gangs were using increasingly sophisticated techniques to harvest useful information such as login details or personal data.\\n\\nOlder attacks relied on users not spotting the fact that the site they were visiting was fake, but more recent phishing e-mails simply try to steal details as soon as a message is opened. Other phishing scams try to recruit innocent people into acting as middlemen for laundering money or goods bought with stolen credit cards. \"E-mail security attacks remain unabated in their persistence and ferocity,\" said Mark Sunner, chief technology officer at MessageLabs. \"In just 12 months phishing has firmly established itself as a threat to any organisation or individual conducting business online,\" he said. Mr Sunner said MessageLabs was starting to see some phishing attacks become very focused on one company or organisation. \"Already particular businesses are threatened and blackmailed, indicating a shift from the random, scattergun approach, to customised attacks designed to take advantage of the perceived weaknesses of some businesses,\" he said. Although phishing attacks grew substantially throughout 2004, viruses and spam remain popular with cyber-criminals and vandals. One of the biggest outbreaks took place in January when the MyDoom virus started circulating. To date the company has caught more than 60 million copies of the virus. Also up this year was the amount of spam in circulation. In 2003 only 40% of messages were spam. But by the end of 2004, almost three-quarters of messages were junk.\\n',\n",
       " 'Search sites get closer to users\\n\\nSearch sites want to get to know you better.\\n\\nNot content with providing access to the millions of websites, many now offer ways that do a better job of remembering, cataloguing and managing all the information you come across. Some of the latest to update their search systems are Ask Jeeves and Blinkx, which have both released a series of utilities that try to help people get more from the web. \"The future is all about developing your own personal web,\" said Tony Macklin, spokesman for Ask Jeeves.\\n\\nMr Macklin said that too often when people use a search engine it was like the first time they ever used it, because there was no memory of what they had searched for before. \"Each time you go back in you have to start all over again,\" he said. The series of updates to its service, collected under the My Ask Jeeves banner, would help people remember where they had been before.\\n\\nAsk Jeeves has added the ability to \"save\" websites of interest so the next time a users visits the site they can search through the sites they have previously found. Sites saved in this way can be arranged in folders and have notes attached to them to explain why they were saved. Mr Macklin said many people wanted to save sites they had seen but did not want to add them to their bookmarks or favourites not least because such lists cannot be easily searched. On average, said Mr Macklin, users conduct between five and 10 searches per day and the tools in My Ask Jeeves should stop them having to do searches twice and get to what they want much more easily. Under My Ask Jeeves users can search the web or through the results they have already noted as interesting. \"It\\'s about finding again what you found before,\" he said. The My Ask Jeeves service lets people store up to a 1000 web links or 5000 if they sign up to the free service. By way of comparison Google\\'s Desktop search tool catalogues search histories informally and lets people look through the sites they have visited.\\n\\nAt the same time, search start-up Blinkx has released a second version of its eponymous software. Blinkx is desktop search software that watches what someone is working on, be it a document or e-mail, and suggests websites, video clips, blogs or documents on a PC that are relevant to it.\\n\\nSince Blinkx launched it has faced increased competition from firms such as Google, Copernic, Enfish, X1 and Apple all of whom now have programs that let people search their PC as well as the web. \"The competition has validated the problem we tackle,\" said Suranga Chandratillake, co-founder of Blinkx. In the latest release of Blinkx, the company has added what it calls smart folders. Once created the folders act as persistent queries that automatically sweep the web for pages related to their subject and catalogues relevant information, documents or incoming e-mails, on hard drives too. What users do with Blinkx and other desktop search engines shows that people tend to be very promiscuous in their use of search engines. \"Blinkx users do not stop using other web search systems,\" he said. \"They might use Google to look up a company, or Yahoo for travel because they know they are good at that,\" he said. \"The classic thing we have seen recently, is people using Blinkx to look at the things they have searched on,\" he said. The variety of ways to search data was only helping users, said Mr Chandratillake and that it was likely that in the future people would use different ones for different tasks.\\n',\n",

They say that no matter how effective technology is at rescuing files, users should take more time to back-up and protect important files. The list of the top 10 global data disasters was compiled by recovery company Ontrack.\\n\\nCareless - and preventable - mistakes that result in data loss range from reckless file maintenance practices to episodes of pure rage towards a computer. This last category includes the case of a man who became so mad with his malfunctioning laptop that he threw it in the lavatory and flushed a couple of times. \"Data can disappear as a result of natural disaster, system fault or computer virus, but human error, including \\'computer rage\\', seems to be a growing problem,\" said Adrian Palmer, managing director of Ontrack Data Recovery.\\n\\n\"Nevertheless, victims soon calm down when they realise the damage they\\'ve done and come to us with pleas for help to retrieve their valuable information.\" A far more common situation is when a computer virus strikes and leads to precious files being corrupted or deleted entirely. Mr Palmer recalled the case of a couple who had hundreds of pictures of their baby\\'s first three months on their computer, but managed to reformat the hard drive and erase all the precious memories. \"Data can be recovered from computers, servers and even memory cards used in digital devices in most cases,\" said Mr Palmer. \"However, individuals and companies can avoid the hassle and stress this can cause by backing up data on a regular basis.\"\\n',\n",

Ask Jeeves, once among the best-known names on the web, is now a relatively modest player. Its $17m profit for the quarter was dwarfed by the $204m announced by rival Google earlier in the week.

Allied Domecq shares in London rose 4% by 1200 GMT, while Pernod shares in Paris slipped 1.2%. Pernod said it was seeking acquisitions but refused to comment on specifics.\\n\\nPernod's last major purchase was a third of US giant Seagram in 2000, the move which propelled it into the global top three of drinks firms. The other two-thirds of Seagram was bought by market leader Diageo. In terms of market value, Pernod - at 7.5bn euros ($9.7bn) - is about 9% smaller than Allied Domecq, which has a capitalisation of Â£5.7bn ($10.7bn; 8.2bn euros). Last year Pernod tried to buy Glenmorangie, one of Scotland's premier whisky firms, but lost out to luxury goods firm LVMH.

The fine was far less than the expected amount of about Â£22,000 or even the suspension of his coaching licence. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, who was fined Â£15,000 in December for accusing Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy of cheating, believes that Aragones\\' punishment was too lenient. \"You compare his fine and my fine, and if you consider his was for racist abuse, then you seem to get away with it more in Spain than you should,\" Wenger said. \"He shouldn\\'t have said what he said, and how much money is enough, I don\\'t know but it doesn\\'t look a big punishment.\" However, Aragones insists the fine is unjustified and unfair. \"I have been treated like Islero (the bull that killed famous bullfighter Manolete),\" said Aragones on hearing he had been fined for his actions. \"I have not liked one thing about this whole affair and I do not agree with the sanction. They have looked for a scapegoat.\" Spain\\'s anti-violence commission must now ratify the Spanish FA\\'s decision and has until next week to announce its verdict.

If a club want to sell you, there is nothing you can do. You can be sold like cattle.\" Sir Alex Ferguson surprised the football world - and Stam - by selling the Dutchman to Lazio for Â£16.5m in August 2001. The decision came shortly after Stam claimed in his autobiography that Ferguson had tapped him up when he was at PSV Eindhoven. But Ferguson insisted he sold the defender because the transfer fee was too good to refuse for a player past his prime. The affair still rankles with the Dutchman.\\n\\n\"I was settled at Manchester United, I had even just ordered a new kitchen, but they wanted to sell me,\" he said. \"In what other industry can a good employee be ushered out the door against their wishes? \"Of course, you can refuse to go, but then the club have the power to put you on the bench.

       " 'High fuel prices hit BA\\'s profits\\n\\nBritish Airways has blamed high fuel prices for a 40% drop in profits.\\n\\nReporting its results for the three months to 31 December 2004, the airline made a pre-tax profit of Â£75m ($141m) compared with Â£125m a year earlier. Rod Eddington, BA\\'s chief executive, said the results were \"respectable\" in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by Â£106m or 47.3%. BA\\'s profits were still better than market expectation of Â£59m, and it expects a rise in full-year revenues.\\n\\nTo help offset the increased price of aviation fuel, BA last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers.\\n\\nIn October, it increased this from Â£6 to Â£10 one-way for all long-haul flights, while the short-haul surcharge was raised from Â£2.50 to Â£4 a leg. Yet aviation analyst Mike Powell of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein says BA\\'s estimated annual surcharge revenues - Â£160m - will still be way short of its additional fuel costs - a predicted extra Â£250m. Turnover for the quarter was up 4.3% to Â£1.97bn, further benefiting from a rise in cargo revenue. Looking ahead to its full year results to March 2005, BA warned that yields - average revenues per passenger - were expected to decline as it continues to lower prices in the face of competition from low-cost carriers. However, it said sales would be better than previously forecast. \"For the year to March 2005, the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a 3% to 3.5% improvement anticipated,\" BA chairman Martin Broughton said. BA had previously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in full-year revenue.\\n\\nIt also reported on Friday that passenger numbers rose 8.1% in January. Aviation analyst Nick Van den Brul of BNP Paribas described BA\\'s latest quarterly results as \"pretty modest\". \"It is quite good on the revenue side and it shows the impact of fuel surcharges and a positive cargo development, however, operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are very strong,\" he said. Since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, BA has cut 13,000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive. \"Our focus remains on reducing controllable costs and debt whilst continuing to invest in our products,\" Mr Eddington said. \"For example, we have taken delivery of six Airbus A321 aircraft and next month we will start further improvements to our Club World flat beds.\" BA\\'s shares closed up four pence at 274.5 pence.\\n',\n",

The court in Washington found that the case could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws. Among the accused were Altria Group, RJ Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, Liggett Group and Brown and Williamson. In its case, the government claimed tobacco firms manipulated nicotine levels to increase addiction, targeted teenagers with multi-billion dollar advertising campaigns, lied about the dangers of smoking and ignored research to the contrary.\\n\\nProsecutors wanted the cigarette firms to surrender $280bn in profits accumulated over the past 50 years and impose tougher rules on marketing their products. But the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the US government could not sue the firms under legislation drawn up to counteract Mafia infiltration of business. The tobacco companies deny that they illegally conspired to promote smoking and defraud the public. They also say they have already met many of the government's demands in a landmark $206bn settlement reached with 46 states in 1998. Shares of tobacco companies closed higher after the ruling, with Altria rising 5% and Reynolds showing gains of 4.5%.\\n\",\n",

       " 'Row brewing over peer-to-peer ads\\n\\nMusic download networks are proving popular not just with an audience of youngsters keen to take advantage of free music but with advertisers equally keen to reach out to a captive audience.\\n\\nThe debate over the legitimacy of file-sharing networks rages on as the music industry continues its threats to close the services down for good. Meanwhile the millions of downloaders are proving both an advertiser\\'s dream come true and a branding nightmare. Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit - a peer to peer service which provides paid-for music downloads - believes it is time advertisers stopped providing \\'oxygen\\' for companies that support illegal downloading. \"You may be surprised to know that current advertisers on the most popular peer to peer service eDonkey who now steadfastly support copyright theft with real cash money include Nat West, Vodafone, O2, First Direct, NTL, and Renault,\" he said in an open letter to the British Phonographic Industry last month.\\n\\nHe urged people to follow his lead and \\'dump\\' brands associated with companies such as eDonkey. The BPI is equally quick to condemn established brands becoming bedfellows with peer to peer networks. \\'Networks like eDonkey, Kazaa and Grokster facilitate illegal filesharing. The BPI strongly believes that any reputable company should look carefully at the support they are giving these networks through their advertising revenue,\" it said in a statement. \"Illegal file-sharers steal millions of pounds worth of music through these services. We are sure that the companies advertising on them would not put up with theft on such a scale from their own businesses,\" it said. But the issue is often more complicated for advertisers, said Mark Mulligan, a music analyst with Jupiter Research. \"This has been a problem for a long time, ever since the days of Napster,\" he told the BBC News website.\\n\\nThe reality is that the millions of downloaders represent a very attractive audience. \"Advertisers probably pay a lot less for putting ads here than on more respected sites and they are reaching the perfect target audience,\" he said. \"If you put the legality issues aside, not to advertise here would mean missing out on a valuable audience,\" he added. Meanwhile companies contacted by the BBC News website insist that they were not directly aware of where their ads have been appearing. OneTel adverts were spotted on eDonkey this week and its response was typical. \"We have investigated this matter and believe that one of our affiliate partners has placed this advert without our knowledge. It is not our policy to advertise through peer-to-peer networks,\" read a statement from the discount phone firm. It has requested the advert be removed immediately, said a spokeswoman. Similarly telecommunications firm NTL blames its media buying agency which places adverts with third party networks featuring thousands of sites. Since the matter was brought to its attention last month, the agency has strict instructions to make sure ads do not appear on such sites, a spokesman told the BBC News website.\\n\\nHowever Mr Mulligan was not entirely convinced by these explanations. While smaller brands might not necessarily be aware of where the money they allocate to online advertising actually ends, this is no excuse for well-known brands, he said. \"I would be surprised if these brands didn\\'t have the know-how to prevent this happening,\" he said. At the moment eDonkey is enjoying the benefits of having some very well-known faces advert on its network. \"Many big brands have leveraged the opportunity, including perhaps two of the biggest brands in the world - Senator John Kerry and President George W. Bush,\" said chief executive Sam Yagan. There are some distinct advantages of advertising on such a network, he thinks. \"Peer-to-peer clients offer big brands a unique opportunity to engage with their customers where they\\'re most comfortable: at their desks interacting with their favourite digital media,\" he said.\\n',\n",
       " 'Lifestyle \\'governs mobile choice\\'\\n\\nFaster, better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets, research suggests.\\n\\nInstead, phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake. Consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size, onboard memory or the chip inside, shows an in-depth study by handset maker Ericsson. \"Historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology,\" said Dr Michael Bjorn, senior advisor on mobile media at Ericsson\\'s consumer and enterprise lab. \"We have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives,\" he said. \"We should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing,\" he told the BBC News website.\\n\\nFor the study, Ericsson interviewed 14,000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone. \"People\\'s habits remain the same,\" said Dr Bjorn. \"They just move the activity into the mobile phone as it\\'s a much more convenient way to do it.\"\\n\\nOne good example of this was diary-writing among younger people, he said. While diaries have always been popular, a mobile phone -- especially one equipped with a camera -- helps them keep it in a different form. Youngsters\\' use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way. Dr Bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it, the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles. Ericsson\\'s research has shown that consumers divide into different \"tribes\" that use phones in different ways. Dr Bjorn said groups dubbed \"pioneers\" and \"materialists\" were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use. \"For instance,\" he said, \"older people are using SMS much more than they did five years ago.\" This was because younger users, often the children of ageing mobile owners, encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch.\\n\\nAnother factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists. Only when about 25% of people have handsets with new innovations on them, such as cameras, can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it.\\n\\nOnce this significant number of users is passed, use of new innovations tends to take off. Dr Bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in Japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop. However, he said, now 45% of the Japanese people Ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month. In 2003 the figure was 29%. Similarly, across Europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise. In 2003 only 4% of the people in the UK took a phonecam snap at least once a month. Now the figure is 14%. Similar rises have been seen in many other European nations. Dr Bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras. \"Usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras,\" he said. Digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings, holidays and birthdays. By contrast, he said, camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life.\\n',\n",

A study revealed that 86% of visitors to the Library carried laptops. The technology has been on trial since May and usage levels make the Library London\\'s most active public hotspot.\\n\\nPreviously many were leaving the building to go to a nearby internet caf&#233; to access their e-mail, the study found. \"At the British Library we are continually exploring ways in which technology can help us to improve services to our users,\" said Lynne Brindley, chief executive of the British Library. \"Surveys we conducted recently confirmed that, alongside the materials they consult here, our users want to be able to access the internet when they are at the Library for research or to communicate with colleagues,\" she said. The service will be priced at Â£4.50 for an hour\\'s session or Â£35 for a monthly pass. The study, conducted by consultancy Building Zones, found that 16% of visitors came to the Library to sit down and use it as a business centre. This could be because of its proximity to busy mainline stations such as Kings Cross and Euston. The study also found that people were spending an average of six hours in the building, making it an ideal wireless hotspot. Since May the service has registered 1,200 sessions per week, making it London\\'s most active public hotspot. The majority of visitors wanted to be able to access their e-mail as well as the British Library catalogue. The service has been rolled out in partnership with wireless provider The Cloud and Hewlett Packard.\\n\\nIt will operate independently from the Library\\'s existing network. The British Library receives around 3,000 visitors each day and serves around 500,000 readers each year. People come to view resources which include the world\\'s largest collection of patents and the UK\\'s most extensive collection of science, technology and medical information.

       " 'Toxic web links help virus spread\\n\\nVirus writers have begun using the power of the web to spread their malicious wares.\\n\\nA Windows virus called Bofra is turning infected machines into distributors of its malicious code. Those clicking on the poisoned links in e-mail messages sent out by infected machines may fall victim to the virus. The trick is being used to prevent the progam being caught by anti-virus software that combs through code contained in e-mail attachments.\\n\\nThe virus that uses this trick is called Bofra and the first member of the family of worms appeared on 10 November. They exploit a Windows vulnerability that was discovered only a few days earlier.\\n\\nLike many other recent viruses, Bofra plunders the address book in Microsoft Outlook for e-mail addresses and scours other files on an infected machine for fresh target addresses. The virus uses its own mail sending software to despatch e-mail messages to potential victims but, unlike many other recent viruses, does not itself travel via mail. Instead the body of the mail messages sent out contain fake weblinks that, when clicked on, connect back to the machine that distributed that e-mail. Essentially, Bofra turns infected machines into small web servers that happily dole out copies of the virus. The messages try to trick people into clicking on the links by promising pornographic videos and images or by posing as payment confirmation for a Paypal transaction.\\n\\nCopies of the messages seen by the BBC News website had bright yellow and green backgrounds. Those clicking on the links will inadvertently download the Bofra virus which will then start searching for new addresses to send itself to. Filtering firm Clearswift said this tactic of creating thousands of mini web servers was designed to help the virus spread quickly and avoid attempts to shut it down. In the past other malicious programs have relied on a single web server that downloads viral code to target machines. Shutting down this central server usually stops the virus spreading.\\n\\nClearswift said that fact that no viral code travels in the e-mail messages sent out by machines infected by Bofra could hamper effects to limit its spread. Finnish anti-virus firm F-Secure said that, so far, it had not seen many copies of the Bofra virus and its variants in circulation.\\n\\nTim Warner, spokesman for anti-virus firm Finjan, said: \"You have people getting very creative now to deliver the virus and get it propagating.\" Mr Warner said organisations needed to prepare deep defences to keep out the modern form of malicious mobile code. \"Most firms have secured their e-mail gateway,\" said Mr Warner, \"but the irony is that most of them let malicious content through the web gateways.\" He said behavioural systems that monitor what users do can help to spot when viruses have penetrated organisations and have started hunting for other victims. The Bofra family of viruses, which were originally thought to be offshoots of the MyDoom bug, can infect machines running Windows 2000, 95, 98, Me, NT, XP and Server 2003. Users running Windows XP that have applied the SP2 update are not vulnerable to the loophole that Bofra exploits.\\n',\n",

On an annual basis, the data suggests annual growth of just 0.2%, suggesting a much more hesitant recovery than had previously been thought. A common technical definition of a recession is two successive quarters of negative growth.\\n\\nThe government was keen to play down the worrying implications of the data. \"I maintain the view that Japan\\'s economy remains in a minor adjustment phase in an upward climb, and we will monitor developments carefully,\" said economy minister Heizo Takenaka. But in the face of the strengthening yen making exports less competitive and indications of weakening economic conditions ahead, observers were less sanguine. \"It\\'s painting a picture of a recovery... much patchier than previously thought,\" said Paul Sheard, economist at Lehman Brothers in Tokyo.

President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono\\'s government has said it wants to curb fuel subsidies and direct the money into aid programmes for the poor. But critics argue cutting subsidies will hurt the poorer families that his government says it wants to help. Millions of people were left homeless in Indonesia Aceh\\'s region following the earthquake and tsunami disaster in late December.\\n\\nIndonesia pays subsidies to importers in order to stabilise domestic fuel prices, but higher oil prices have forced the government to spend more on holding prices down. It spent 59.2 trillion rupiah ($6.58bn; Â£3.5bn) on fuel subsidies in 2004, a sum far in excess of its original projection of 14.5 trillion rupiah. Since President Yudhoyono\\'s government came to power in October, it has indicated its intention of raising domestic fuel prices by cutting subsidies. \"The (January to March) quarter of this year is the best time for us to increase fuel prices,\" said Sri Mulyani Indrawati, State Minister for National Development Planning. \"We are still considering if a 30% hike is suitable at the moment. The sooner the better for the state budget.\" The BBC\\'s correspondent in Jakarta, Rachel Harvey, told World Business Report that there was likely to be a strong public reaction to any price rise. \"The big question is whether they go for one big, short, sharp shock and raise prices between 20% and 30% or whether they try to stagger it,\" she said.

Chelsea have decided to write off a possible transfer fee for Mutu, a £15.8m signing from Parma last season, who may face a two-year suspension. A statement from Chelsea explaining the decision read:\"We want to make clear that Chelsea has a zero tolerance policy towards drugs.\" Mutu scored six goals in his first five games after arriving at Stamford Bridge but his form went into decline and he was frozen out by coach Jose Mourinho. Chelsea\\'s statement added: \"This applies to both performance-enhancing drugs or so-called \\'recreational\\' drugs. They have no place at our club or in sport. \"In coming to a decision on this case, Chelsea believed the club\\'s social responsibility to its fans, players, employees and other stakeholders in football regarding drugs was more important than the major financial considerations to the company. \"Any player who takes drugs breaches his contract with the club as well as Football Association rules. \"The club totally supports the FA in strong action on all drugs cases.\" Fifa\\'s disciplinary code stipulates that a first doping offence should be followed by a six-month ban. And the sport\\'s world governing body has re-iterated their stance over Mutu\\'s failed drugs test, maintaining it is a matter for the domestic sporting authorities. \"Fifa is not in a position to make any comment on the matter until the English FA have informed us of their disciplinary decision and the relevant information associated with it,\" said a Fifa spokesman. Chelsea\\'s move won backing from drug-testing expert Michelle Verroken. Verroken, a former director of drug-free sport for UK Sport, insists the Blues were right to sack Mutu and have enhanced their reputation by doing so. \"Chelsea are saying quite clearly to the rest of their players and their fans that this is a situation they are not prepared to tolerate. \"It was a very difficult decision for them and an expensive decision for them but the terms of his contract were breached and it was the only decision they could make. \"It is a very clear stance by Chelsea and it has given a strong boost to the reputation of the club.\" It emerged that Mutu had failed a drugs test on October 18 and, although it was initially reported that the banned substance in question was cocaine.

I like to play in games like this with this intense rivalry.\" But Edu was highly critical of the ferocity of some of United\\'s challenges during the game, particularly on Jose Antonio Reyes. \"I think we were a lot fairer in the tackles than United,\" he said. \"Reyes was being kicked all over the park - they were beating up the boy and Gary Neville was tackling in such a way that he should have been sent off.\" Following the game, the Football Association said it would look into events in the tunnel. It also charged Ruud van Nistelrooy with serious foul play while Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has been asked to explain comments he made about the referee.\\n',\n",
       " \"Peugeot deal boosts Mitsubishi\\n\\nStruggling Japanese car maker Mitsubishi Motors has struck a deal to supply French car maker Peugeot with 30,000 sports utility vehicles (SUV).\\n\\nThe two firms signed a Memorandum of Understanding, and say they expect to seal a final agreement by Spring 2005. The alliance comes as a badly-needed boost for loss-making Mitsubishi, after several profit warnings and poor sales. The SUVs will be built in Japan using Peugeot's diesel engines and sold mainly in the European market. Falling sales have left Mitsubishi Motors with underused capacity, and the production deal with Peugeot gives it a chance to utilise some of it.\\n\\nIn January, Mitsubishi Motors issued its third profits warning in nine months, and cut its sales forecasts for the year to March 2005. Its sales have slid 41% in the past year, catalysed by the revelation that the company had systematically been hiding records of faults and then secretly repairing vehicles. As a result, the Japanese car maker has sought a series of financial bailouts. Last month it said it was looking for a further 540bn yen ($5.2bn; Â£2.77bn) in fresh financial backing, half of it from other companies in the Mitsubishi group. US-German carmaker DaimlerChrylser, a 30% shareholder in Mitsubishi Motors, decided in April 2004 not to pump in any more money. The deal with Peugeot was celebrated by Mitsubishi's newly-appointed chief executive Takashi Nishioka, who took over after three top bosses stood down last month to shoulder responsibility for the firm's troubles. Mitsubishi Motors has forecast a net loss of 472bn yen in its current financial year to March 2005. Last month, it signed a production agreement with Japanese rival Nissan Motor to supply it with 36,000 small cars for sale in Japan. It has been making cars for Nissan since 2003.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Jobs growth still slow in the US\\n\\nThe US created fewer jobs than expected in January, but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years.\\n\\nAccording to Labor Department figures, US firms added only 146,000 jobs in January. The gain in non-farm payrolls was below market expectations of 190,000 new jobs. Nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to 5.2%, its lowest level since September 2001. The job gains mean that President Bush can celebrate - albeit by a very fine margin - a net growth in jobs in the US economy in his first term in office. He presided over a net fall in jobs up to last November\\'s Presidential election - the first President to do so since Herbert Hoover. As a result, job creation became a key issue in last year\\'s election. However, when adding December and January\\'s figures, the administration\\'s first term jobs record ended in positive territory.\\n\\nThe Labor Department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in December 2004, from 157,000 to 133,000.\\n\\nAnalysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions. \"It suggests that employment is continuing to expand at a moderate pace,\" said Rick Egelton, deputy chief economist at BMO Financial Group. \"We are not getting the boost to employment that we would have got given the low value of the dollar and the still relatively low interest rate environment.\" \"The economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth,\" said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics. \"That means there are a limited number of new opportunities for workers.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Millions to miss out on the net\\n\\nBy 2025, 40% of the UK\\'s population will still be without internet access at home, says a study.\\n\\nAround 23 million Britons will miss out on a wide range of essential services such as education and medical information, predicts the report by telecoms giant BT. It compares to 27 million, or 50%, of the UK, who are not currently online. The idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is \"wishful thinking\", the report concludes.\\n\\nThe study calls on the government and telecoms industry to come up with new ways to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution. Although the percentage of Britons without home access will have fallen slightly, those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more, the report suggests. As more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive, the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access, it predicts.\\n\\nThe gap between \"have-nets\" and \"have-nots\" has been much talked about, but predictions about how such a divide will affect future generations has been less discussed. BT set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing. Optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark, the report suggests. \"Internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it,\" said Adrian Hosford, director of corporate responsibility at BT. Costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological. \"There is a hard rump of have-nots who are not engaging with the net. They don\\'t have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits,\" said Mr Hosford.\\n\\nAs now, the most disadvantaged groups are likely to remain among low income families, the older generation and the disabled.\\n\\nThose on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots, the disabled will make up 16% and the elderly nearly a third by 2025, the report forecasts. Organisations such as BT have a responsibility to help tackle the problem, said Mr Hosford. The telco has seen positive results with its Everybody Online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around Britain. In one area of Cornwall with high levels of unemployment, online training helped people rewrite CVs and learn skills to get new jobs, explained Mr Hosford. Such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome, he said. \"If we don\\'t address this problem now, it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs, education opportunities will be limited and they\\'ll simply not be able to keep up with society,\" he said. The Alliance for Digital Inclusion, an independent body with members drawn from government, industry and the voluntary sector has recently been set up to tackle some of the issues faced by the digital refuseniks.\\n',\n",
       " 'UK broadband gets speed injection\\n\\nBroadband\\'s rapid rise continues apace as speeds gear up a notch.\\n\\nAn eight megabit service has been launched by internet service provider UK Online. It is 16 times faster than the average broadband package on the market and will pave the way for services such as video-on-demand and broadband TV. The service is possible due to a new regime which allows other operators to use BT\\'s exchanges and will initially only be available in towns.\\n\\nIt represents a \"big leap forward\" for broadband, said Chris Stening, UK Online general manager.\\n\\nThe service comes with a hefty Â£39.99 monthly price tag but will mean users can download MP3s in seconds and offers TV-quality video streaming. The service includes WiFi as standard, meaning users can connect multiple PCs, laptops and game consoles from any room in the house. Not everybody will be able to take advantage of the service, as it will be restricted to metropolitan areas. The service will initially be available to users within 2km radius of 230 telephone exchanges in areas such as London, Birmingham, Glasgow and Cambridge. That represents about 4.4 million households. The service is possible due to a decision to loosen BT\\'s strangle-hold on telephone exchanges.\\n\\nThe process, known as local loop unbundling, was put in motion by the now defunct telecoms watchdog Oftel but has only proved popular in recent months due to falling costs. UK Online is looking at the possibility of bundling services such as cheap net telephone calls, video-on-demand and TV by 2005 if the service proves popular. \"The service is twice as fast as any other service on offer in the UK and 16 times faster than most broadband services,\" said Mr Stening. \"It takes a big leap for broadband and we are very excited about it,\" he said. Countries such as South Korea and France have found the advantage of upping the speeds of broadband. In South Korea, video-on-demand over the net is cheaper than renting a DVD and online gaming is huge. Mr Stening believes the service will appeal to people in multi-occupancy buildings as well as easing family arguments. \"A typical family with two adults and two children is currently sharing a 512 kilobit service. This will basically give them 2 megabits each,\" he said.\\n',\n",
       " \"Go-ahead for new internet names\\n\\nThe internet could soon have two new domain names, aimed at mobile services and the jobs market.\\n\\nThe Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann) has given preliminary approval to two new addresses - .mobi and .jobs. They are among 10 new names being considered by the net's oversight body. Others include a domain for pornography, an anti-spam domain as well as .post and .travel, for the postal and travel industries.\\n\\nThe .mobi domain would be aimed at websites and other services that work specifically around mobile phones, while the .jobs address could be used by companies wanting a dedicated site for job postings. The process to see the new domain names go live in cyberspace could take months and Icann officials warned that there were no guarantees they would ultimately be accepted. Applicants paid Â£23,000 apiece to have their proposals considered. The application for .mobi was sponsored by technology firms including Nokia, Microsoft and T-Mobile.\\n\\nOf the 10 currently under consideration, the least likely to win approval is the .xxx domain for pornographic websites. There are currently around 250 domain names in use around the globe, mostly for specific countries such as .fr for France and .uk for Britain. Perhaps unsurprisingly, .com remains the most popular address on the web.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Britons growing \\'digitally obese\\'\\n\\nGadget lovers are so hungry for digital data many are carrying the equivalent of 10 trucks full of paper in \"weight\".\\n\\nMusic, images, e-mails, and texts are being hoarded on mobiles, cameras laptops and PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants), a Toshiba study found. It found that more than 60% kept 1,000 to 2,000 music files on their devices, making the UK \"digitally fat\". \"Virtual weight\" measurements are based on research by California Institute of Technology professor Roy Williams. He calculated physical comparisons for digital data in the mid-1990s. He worked out that one gigabyte (1,000,000,000 bytes) was the equivalent of a pick-up truck filled with paper. The amount of data people are squirreling away on their gadgets is clearly a sign that people are finding more things to do with their shiny things.\\n\\nIf digital hoarding habits continue on this scale, people could be carrying around a \"digitally obese\" 20 gigabytes by next year. \"Britain has become a nation of information hoarders with a ferocious appetite for data,\" said Martin Larsson, general manager of Toshiba\\'s European storage device division.\\n\\n\"As storage capabilities increase and the features and functionalities of mobile devices expand to support movie files and entire libraries of multi-media content, we will all become virtually obese,\" he told the BBC News website. The survey reflects the increasing trend for portable devices with built-in hard drives like music and media players from Apple, Creative Labs, Archos, iRiver and others. This trend is set to grow, according to analysts. They suggest the number of hard drives in consumer electronics gadgets could grow from 17 million last year to 55 million in 2006. \"Consumers are driving the move towards smaller devices that have greater functionality, and industry is trying to keep up,\" said Mr Larsson. \"People are looking for more than just phone calls and text messages on the move, they want things like web browsing, e-mailing, music, photos and more.\"\\n\\nMany are finding memory keys and memory sticks are simply not big enough to hold everything.\\n\\n\"Floppies and memory keys have their place, but they don\\'t have anything like the capacity or flexibility of a hard drive so are unable to meet the demand for more and more storage capacity in consumer devices,\" said Mr Larsson. The cost of making hard drives has dropped and is continuing to do so because of improved technologies so they are proving to be more cost-effective than other forms of memory, he added. The amount of data that can be stored has grown by 400% in the last three years, while the cost for every gigabyte has fallen by 80%. It is also getting easier to transfer files from one device to another, which has traditionally been a slow and problematic area. \"Transfer of data between different memory types has improved significantly in recent times, and will be further helped by the standards for hard drives which are currently being developed by the major manufacturers,\" said Mr Larsson. According to technology analysts IDC, a fifth of all hard drives produced will be used in consumer electronics by 2007.\\n',\n",
       " 'Mobile multimedia slow to catch on\\n\\nThere is no doubt that mobile phones sporting cameras and colour screens are hugely popular. Consumers swapping old phones for slinkier, dinkier versions are thought to be responsible for a 26% increase in the number of phones sold during the third quarter of 2004, according to analysts Gartner More than 167 million handsets were sold between July and September 2004, a period that, according to Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi is \"seldom strong\". But although consumers have mobiles that can take and send snaps, sounds and video clips few, so far, are taking the chance to do so.\\n\\nIn fact, the numbers of people not taking and sending pictures, audio and video is growing. Figures gathered by Continental Research shows that 36% of British camera phone users have never sent a multimedia message (MMS), up from 7% in 2003. This is despite the fact that, during the same period, the numbers of camera phones in the UK more than doubled to 7.5 million. Getting mobile phone users to send multimedia messages is really important for operators keen to squeeze more cash out of their customers and offset the cost of subsidising the handsets people are buying. The problem they face, said Shailendra Jain, head of MMS firm Adamind, is educating people in how to send the multimedia messages using their funky handsets.\\n\\n\"Also,\" he said, \"they have to simplify the interface so its not rocket science in terms of someone understanding it.\" Research bears out the suspicion that people are not sending multimedia messages because they do not know how to. According to Continental Research, 29% of the people it questioned said they were technophobes that tended to shy away from innovation. Only 11% regarded themselves as technically savvy enough to send a picture or video message. The fact that multimedia services are not interoperable across networks and phones only adds to people\\'s reluctance to start sending them, said Mr Jain. \"They ask themselves: \\'If I\\'m streaming video from one handset to another will it work?\\'\" he said. \"There\\'s a lot of user apprehension about that.\"\\n\\nThere are other deeper technical reasons why multimedia messages are not being pushed as strongly as they might. Andrew Bud, executive chairman of messaging firm Mblox, said mobile phone operators cap the number of messages that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system. \"The rate we can send MMS into the mobile network is fairly constant,\" he said. The reason for this is that there are finite capacities for data traffic on the second generation networks that currently have the most users.\\n\\nNo-one wants to take the risk of swamping these relatively narrow channels so the number of MMS messages is capped, said Mr Bud. This has led to operators finding other technologies, particularly one known as Wap-push, to get multimedia to their customers. But when networks do find a good way to get multimedia to their customers, the results can be dramatic. Israeli technology firm Celltick has found a way to broadcast data across phone networks in a way that does not overwhelm existing bandwidth. One of the first firms to use the Celltick service is Hutch India, the largest mobile firm in the country. The broadcast system gets multimedia to customers via a rolling menu far faster than would be possible with other systems. While not multimedia messaging, such a system gets people used to seeing their phones as a device that can handle all different types of content. As a result 40% of the subscribers to the Hutch Alive, which uses Celltick\\'s broadcast technology, regularly click for more pictures, sounds and images from the operator. \"Operators really need to start utilising this tool to reach their customers,\" said Yaron Toren, spokesman for Celltick. Until then, multimedia will be a message that is not getting through.\\n',\n",
       " 'Mobile picture power in your pocket\\n\\nHow many times have you wanted to have a camera to hand to catch an unexpected event that would make headlines?\\n\\nWith a modern mobile phone that has a camera built in, you no longer need to curse, you can capture the action as it happens. Already on-the-spot snappers are helping newspapers add immediacy to their breaking news stories headlines, where professional photographers only arrive in time for the aftermath. Celebrities might not welcome such a change because they may never be free of a new breed of mobile phone paparazzi making their lives a bit more difficult. Already one tabloid newspaper in LA is issuing photographers with camera phones to help them catch celebrities at play. It could be the start of a trend that only increases as higher resolution phone cameras become more widespread; as video phones catch on and millions of people start carrying the gadgets around.\\n\\nOnly last week, the world media highlighted the killing of the Dutch film maker Theo van Gogh, notorious after making a controversial film about Islamic culture.\\n\\nOne day later De Telegraaf, a daily Amsterdam newspaper, became news on its own when it published a picture taken with a mobile phone of Mr van Gogh\\'s body moments after he was killed. \"This picture was the story\", said De Telegraaf\\'s image editor, Peter Schoonen. Other accounts of such picture phone users witnessing news events, include:\\n\\n\\n - A flight from Switzerland to the Dominican Republic which turned around after someone took a picture of a piece of metal falling from the plane as it took off from Zurich (reported by the Swiss daily Le Matin). \\n - Two crooks who robbed a bank in Denmark were snapped before they carried out the crime waiting for the doors of the building to be opened (reported by the Danish regional paper Aarhus Stiftstidende). \\n \\n\\nBut this is not just about traditional media lending immediacy to their stories with content from ordinary people, it is also about first-hand journalism in the form of online diaries or weblogs.\\n\\nIt has been called \"open source news\" or even \"moblog journalism\" and it has flourished in the recent US election campaign. \"Not many people walk around with their cameras, but they always have their mobile phones with them. If something happens, suddenly all these mobiles sort of appear from nowhere, and start taking pictures,\" said digital artist Henry Reichhold. He himself uses mobile phone pictures to create huge panoramic images of events and places. \"You see it in bars, you see it everywhere. It\\'s a massive thing,\" Mr Reichhold told the BBC News website.\\n\\nWith some picture agencies already paying for exclusive phone pictures, especially of celebrities, there are also fears about the possible downside of this phenomenon.\\n\\nIt could become a nuisance for public figures as higher resolution picture phones hit the market, with five megapixel models already being launched in Asia. Already on US photojournal site, Buzznet, there is a public album full of snaps of celebrities, many of which were taken with camera phones. Tabloid newspapers in the UK and many monthly magazines invite readers to send in images of famous people they have seen and snapped. But there are other positive uses of picture mobile phones that may balance these uses. For instance, in Alabama, in the US, camera phones will be used to take snaps at crime scenes involving children, and help the authorities to arrest and prosecute paedophiles. And in China\\'s capital Beijing, courts have adopted mobile phone photos as formal evidence. For Henry Reichhold, this is progress: \"That\\'s the whole thing about the immediacy of the thing. I can see that happening a lot more.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Sluggish economy hits German jobs\\n\\nThe number of people out of work in Europe\\'s largest economy has risen for the tenth straight month as growth remains stubbornly slow.\\n\\nGerman unemployment rose 7,000 in November to 4.464 million people, or 10.8% of the workforce. The seasonally adjusted rise showed a smaller rise than expected, as government measures to encourage job creation began to take effect. But officials said stagnant growth was still stifling the job market. \"There are clear signs of a revival in domestic demand,\" said Frank-Juergen Weise, head of the Federal Labour Agency, in a statement. \"But growth of 0.1%... in the third quarter is still insufficient to deliver positive momentum to the labour market.\" High oil prices and the soaring euro - which damages the competitiveness of exporters - were also having a negative effect, he said. The brunt of the unemployment is still being felt in the eastern part of Germany, where the rate is 18.8%.\\n\\nWith unemployment stuck above 4 million for years, the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has put job creation at the top of the agenda. A controversial package of measures to shake up incentives to get back to work, paid for by cutting some cherished benefits, has sparked anger among some German workers. Strikes in a number of industries, notably among the country\\'s iconic carmakers, have demonstrated the displeasure - as well as fears about further job losses as outsourcing takes hold. Among the new initiatives are the so-called \"one-euro jobs\" which top up unemployment benefit. The scheme\\'s formal launch is January, but hirings for these positions are already taking place and affecting the unemployment statistics, economists said. \"The deterioration of the labour market does not come as a surprise,\" said Isabelle Kronawitter at Hypovereinsbank. \"Job creation measures probably prevented a stronger increase in the seasonally adjusted numbers.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'US gives foreign firms extra time\\n\\nForeign firms have been given an extra year to meet tough new corporate governance regulations imposed by the US stock market watchdog.\\n\\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has extended the deadline to get in line with the rules until 15 July 2006. Many foreign firms had protested that the SEC was imposing an unfair burden. The new rules are the result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, part of the US clean-up after corporate scandals such as Enron and Worldcom. Section 404 of the Sox Act, as the legislation is nicknamed, calls for all firms to certify that their financial reporting is in line with US rules. Big US firms already have to meet the requirements, but smaller ones and foreign-based firms which list their shares on US stock markets originally had until the middle of this year.\\n\\nOver the past few months, delegations of European and other business leaders have been heading to the SEC\\'s Washington DC headquarters to protest. They say the burden is too expensive and the timescale too short and some, particularly the UK\\'s CBI, warned that companies would choose to let their US listings drop rather than get in line with section 404. The latest delegation from the CBI met SEC officials on Wednesday, just before the decision to relax the deadline was announced. \"I think this signifies a change of heart at the SEC,\" CBI director-general Sir Digby Jones told the BBC\\'s Today programme. \"They have been listening to us and to many overseas companies, who have reminded America what globalisation really means: that they can\\'t make these rules in isolation.\" The SEC said it had taken into consideration the fact that foreign companies were already working to meet more onerous financial reporting rules in their home countries. The European Union, in particular, was imposing new international financial reporting standards in 2005, it noted. \"I don\\'t underestimate the effort (compliance) will require... but this extension will provide additional time for those issuers to take a good hard look at their internal controls,\" said Donald Nicolaisen, the SEC\\'s chief accountant.\\n',\n",

But it was being stressed to BBC Sport that Juninho would prefer to remain with the Scottish champions. Juninho wants assurances that he will return to O\\'Neill\\'s first-team plans. He has become frustrated with his lack of first-team action since his move from Middlesbrough in the summer. Hassel says Juninho, who has just bought a new home, would \"desperately like to stay at Celtic\" but will seek a move if it is made clear that he is not wanted.\\n\\nThe agent also stressed that nothing should be read into the 30-year-old\\'s father being in Scotland and talk of a move back to Botafogo in Brazil. Juninho\\'s father was simply in the country to see his son and grandchildren. \"I know there is interest from a Brazilian club, but I know Juninho doesn\\'t want to go there,\" said Hassel. \"He wants to stay in Britain. In fact, he wants to stay at Celtic.\" Hassall made it clear that a move to Manchester City, who are badly in need of a midfield play-maker, was more of a possibility than Botafogo, or Mexican outfit Red Sharks Veracruz, who also expressed an interest. \"It was a thought at one stage,\" he said. \"If you are not going to get a game under one manager, you look for another whose style of play suits you. \"He is a fan of Kevin Keegan\\'s style of play. It would not be a bad move for him.\" Juninho had earlier told the Daily Record: \"The manager has had a lot of chances to put me in his team but it hasn\\'t happened. \"If that is the case then this is the opportunity for me to go. That would be good for the club and good for me. \"If I have no part in his plans, there is no point in remaining here waiting for a chance that never comes.\" The attacking midfielder also claims he has not had the backing of boss Martin O\\'Neill since his move to Celtic Park. \"I can\\'t understand why I am in this situation,\" he continued. \"When a manager brings a new player to the club, he gives that player support.\"\\n',\n",

They are one of the major clubs in Europe and the pressure will be on Barcelona.\" Chelsea have not played Barcelona since that quarter-final tie five years ago. The Blues had looked destined to progress after winning the first leg at Stamford Bridge 3-1, courtesy of two goals from Tore Andre Flo and one by Gianfranco Zola. But they collapsed in the second leg, going down to strikes from Rivaldo (2), Luis Figo, Dani and Patrick Kluivert.\\n\\nFormer Chelsea captain Desailly, who is now playing for Al-Gharafa in Qatar, says there is no comparison between that side and the current Blues team, who are top of the Premiership. \"Mentally they are much stronger, even though a lot of their players are young,\" the 36-year-old said. \"We made some mistakes at the Nou Camp in 2000 - a lot of them were individual mistakes. \"It would not happen now. This team has a new motivation and a different mentality.\" World Cup winner Desailly saw huge changes during his time at Stamford Bridge. He was signed for Â£4.6m from AC Milan in 1998 by Ruud Gullit and went on to play under Gianluca Vialli and Claudio Ranieri. But the biggest change occurred when billionaire Roman Abramovich bought the club in 2003. Desailly says the Russian\\'s arrival helped to instil a winning mentality at the club as well as a demand for success. \"The whole of Chelsea is different now - the chairman, the manager and all the players,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Everything is new and there is a huge determination to win. \"Since that game in 2000, Chelsea have gained more experience in Europe and were very close to reaching the Champions League final last season.\" Desailly is one of the most decorated players in the history of football. He won the 1998 World Cup and 2000 European Championship with France, the Champions League in 1993 with Marseilles and 1994 with AC Milan, two Serie A titles and the FA Cup in 2000 with Chelsea. He is now winding down his career in Qatar, alongside the likes of Frank Lebeouf, Josep Guardiola, Titi Camara, Gabriel Batistuta and Christophe Dugarry. So he is full of admiration for two of his colleagues from the great Milan side of the mid-90s who are likely to line up against Manchester United on Wednesday - Paolo Maldini and Alessandro Costacurta. \"I\\'m happy that they have managed to play so long at a high level,\" he said. \"I made a vow to Costacurta that as long as he plays, I will continue to play. \"And it\\'s amazing that Paolo has managed to play at such a high level for such a long time.\"\\n',\n",

He believes the prospect of breaking Jackie Milburn\\'s club scoring record may influence the striker\\'s decision.\\n\\nMilburn scored 200 league and cup goals between 1946 and 1957, while Shearer currently has 187 goals to his name. \"Without giving too much away, I am confident he will be here next season,\" said Souness. \"I can\\'t imagine him leaving without breaking Jackie Milburn\\'s scoring record.\" Souness also revealed he tried to bring back Nolberto Solano during the January transfer window. The Peruvian international was sold to Aston Villa a year ago but in the phone-in for BBC Newcastle, Souness said tried to re-sign him, but Villa were not interested in selling.\\n\\nThe former Rangers and Liverpool boss is also looking to bring in a number of new acquisitions once the current campaign has been completed. \"I\\'m after three, four or five new players in the summer - we have got lots of targets,\" he said. \"Don\\'t think we will wait to the last day of the season to say: `Who are we going to target now?\"\\'\\n',\n",

Critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal Europe, but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25-state EU. \"If we reject this treaty, Britain will be isolated and weak in Europe,\" said Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who along with the rest of the Cabinet, will back a \"yes\" vote.\\n\\nPatriots by definition wanted the UK to be prosperous at home and strong and influential abroad, Mr Straw said. \"Our role as a leading member of the EU is a crucial part of securing that.\"\\n\\nConservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said the referendum question \"seems straightforward\". But he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the EU referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution, when they should be treated as \"two separate issues\". Despite this \"underhand trick,\" the referendum bill stood \"no chance of becoming law before the election,\" he added. \"This is Tony Blair\\'s cheap gesture to the pro-constitution lobby while he runs scared of a debate on Europe he knows he cannot win.\" Neil O\\'Brien, director of anti-constitution group Vote No, said: \"The reality is that the government doesn\\'t want to discuss the EU constitution ahead of the election because they know it is extremely unpopular with voters and with business.\"\\n\\nThe UK Independence Party said: \"If the government believes that a No vote would mean that we should leave the European Union, they should just ask us if we want to leave the EU. Then we can be out of it and better off much sooner.\"\\n\\nLiberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy, who backs the constitution, said he expected the referendum would come in the first half of next year. He told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme: \"The sooner we get on with this, the better.\" He said the question sounded \"very neutral\" and \"balanced,\" adding it would enable the argument \"to be enjoined fairly and squarely on both sides\". Green MEP Caroline Lucas welcomed Tony Blair\\'s \"courage in keeping his word\" on holding a referendum. But she added: \"This treaty is a flawed document that will make the EU less accountable, less sustainable, and less just.\"\\n\\nMr Blair signed the constitution at a ceremony in Rome in November, but had already made it clear the issue would be put to voters in a referendum. That promise came after sustained pressure from opposition parties. Jack Straw, who argues the constitution reflected a \"British vision for Europe\" and gives \"national governments a stronger grip\", has said the referendum could be held in spring 2006. But in an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Blair refused to be pinned down to that date, saying Britain would hold a poll \"some time in 2006 but when, I don\\'t know\". The paper said the prime minister \"claimed ignorance\" of when other countries were planning to hold their referendums.\\n',\n",
       " 'Malik rejects all-black MP lists\\n\\nA call for ethnic minority shortlists to boost the number of black and Asian MPs has been rejected by one of Labour\\'s most senior Asians.\\n\\nShahid Malik, who is on Labour\\'s ruling NEC, accepted people\\'s frustration but said there should be targets not lists to boost representation of minorities. Just 13 of Britain\\'s 659 MPs are from ethnic minority groups, he added. Commission for racial equality chief Trevor Phillips argued on Sunday the time had come for such shortlists. That came after it emerged that one of Britain\\'s most ethnically diverse constituency, West Ham, was to get a women-only shortlist for the next election following an NEC ruling.\\n\\nMr Phillips said changes to the race relations legislation might allow political parties to reserve seats for under-represented groups. For example in West Ham, this might allow only women and minorities to seek to be candidates. \"If we get to the other side of the general election and find that minorities are not represented, we have to say that after 20 or 30 years of talking about this, we cannot go on the same way,\" he said. He added: \"It would be terribly disappointing if in the least white constituency [West Ham] in the whole of Europe we didn\\'t have a minority candidate.\" Appearing on BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme, Mr Malik, who is himself running for the seat of Dewsbury, acknowledged that so far women-only shortlists had failed to deliver a boost in the number of ethnic minority candidates.\\n\\nBut he argued: \"I do think that there currently things that parties can do and which they aren\\'t doing... for example setting targets to ensure that existing democratic structures are more reflective.\" Labour MP Diane Abbot, who backs Mr Phillips\\' proposal of shortlists, said she had been elected along with three other ethnic minority MPs - Keith Vaz, Paul Boateng and Bernie Grant - in 1987 but it took another 10 years before another black woman was able to win a seat. That was a rate of progress Ms Abbott described as \"painful\". \"I am a little older than Shahid and served on the National Executive Committee in the 1990s - I was the first black person on the NEC ... crossing our fingers and hoping we are going to get more black and Asian MP hasn\\'t worked,\" she said. \"The shortlist strategy works for women and I believe that it can be made to work for black and Asian people.\" On Tuesday Labour chairman Ian McCartney said his party was \"ambitious\" to improve black and Asian representation. \"We haven\\'t ruled out all-black shortlists and welcome a debate in the party about this,\" he said.\\n',\n",

I feel we really turned in a bad performance. \"At 3-0 we faced a real struggle, but 3-1 at least gives us a chance.\"\\n\\nGoalscorer Toure was also at fault for two goals, and Wenger said: \"We need to help Toure rebuild his confidence as he is low at the moment.\" Wenger also tried to stay upbeat himself, adding: \"But there is enough time for crying. I could cry - maybe it would be easier - but life goes on. \"In this job, you have good and bad nights. This was a bad night - but I still have confidence in the quality of my players, as well as their spirit and desire.\" But Wenger\\'s Bayern counterpart Felix Magath was in no mood to celebrate either. He said: \"I am far from happy despite the win. My players failed to try and score a fourth to kill the tie and then conceded the late goal.\\n\\n\"Arsenal are fully capable of scoring several goals against us on their own turf.\" Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann, whose personal rivalry with Bayern goalkeeper Oliver Kahn was not helped by the result, said: \"Do I blame myself for the third goal? As a goalkeeper, I always blame myself. \"I just know the goals were very easy against us. In my time here, we have never conceded three easy goals like that - but sometimes it happens. \"It would have been impossible to go through at 3-0 - but with the goal we have chances.

Anders Svensson and Matt Oakley are likely replacements with Kevin Phillips also scheduled to start, with Henri Camara rested.\\n\\n- Brentford boss Martin Allen: \"After conceding eight goals in our last three matches, I have to admit I\\'m not very confident. \"There\\'s no doubt we\\'re the underdogs and after defending so poorly recently it\\'s not looking good. \"Southampton have just drawn with the Premiership champions and that makes our task harder than it was already.\" \\n - Southampton boss Harry Redknapp: \"We know they can give us problems. \"Brentford have done well but we are the Premiership side and should have the better players. \"Staying in the Premiership is our priority. We want to win, of course we do. We\\'ll battle but if it comes to a football match I think we\\'ll win.\" KEY MATCH STATS \\n - BRENTFORD are the lowest ranked club left in the FA Cup. They\\'re on their best run in the competition since reaching the quarter-finals for the fourth time in their history 16 years ago. Now they have the carrot of the plum draw in the last eight dangling before them. Victory over Premiership strugglers Southampton, would bring the mighty Manchester United to Griffin Park and a gigantic pay day for the sole League One survivors. \\n - Martin Allen\\'s brave side came back from two goals down at St Mary\\'s to earn a deserved replay. Southampton striker Henri Camara scored twice from close range to put the Saints in command, but Isaiah Rankin hit back just before half time, and Sam Sodje headed past a creaky defence on 58 minutes. \\n - The Londoners have conceded six goals in their two subsequent League outings - three each in losing away to Hartlepool and drawing at home to Sheffield Wednesday. But they haven\\'t lost in six League and Cup games on home turf - winning three and drawing three since the reverse to Torquay on Boxing Day. \\n - SOUTHAMPTON go into this tie on the back of an eventful Premiership match with Arsenal on Saturday. An angry David Prutton pushed referee Alan Wiley after being shown the red card, but his side still came back to draw 1-1. It was Saints\\' fourth stalemate in succession in all competitions, but didn\\'t lift them out of the relegation zone. The retention of their ever present Premier League status must be the number one priority, irrespective of the rewards that success against Brentford would bring. \\n - Victory here would set up a repeat of the 1976 final, when Saints astounded the football world by defeating Tommy Docherty\\'s Manchester United courtesy of Bobby Stokes\\' famous winner. They also knocked out the Red Devils in 1991 on penalties in the fourth round. But to write another chapter in their FA Cup history, the Solent side must avoid succumbing to lower division opposition for the first time since Rotherham, from the second level, beat them 2-1 in a third round tie at Millmoor on 16 January 2002. Southampton were last humbled by a club from the third tier six years ago. Fulham were then in the Second Division, when they won a third round replay at Craven Cottage 1-0 on 13 January 1999. \\n - To get to within two matches of a second visit to the Millennium Stadium in three years for the final, Harry Redknapp must guide his side past a club 36 places inferior on the League ladder, and a manager 19 years his junior, who played under him at West Ham.

Klinsmann said: \"It will be difficult for any of our players if he is not a first-choice at his club. \"If Jens is not Arsenal\\'s number one keeper, that is a problem for me. He must be playing regularly.\" Lehmann is desperate to keep his place in the Germany squad when the country hosts the World Cup in 2006.

       " 'Japanese mogul arrested for fraud\\n\\nOne of Japan\\'s best-known businessmen was arrested on Thursday on charges of falsifying shareholder information and selling shares based on the false data.\\n\\nYoshiaki Tsutsumi was once ranked as the world\\'s richest man and ran a business spanning hotels, railways, construction and a baseball team. His is the latest in a series of arrests of top executives in Japan over business scandals. He was taken away in a van outside one of his Prince hotels in Tokyo.\\n\\nThere was a time when Mr Tsutsumi seemed untouchable. Inheriting a large property business from his father in the 1960s, he became one of Japan\\'s most powerful industrialists, with close connections to many of the country\\'s leading politicians. He used his wealth and influence to bring the Winter Olympic Games to Nagano in 1998. But last year, he was forced to resign from all the posts he held in his business empire, after being accused of falsifying the share-ownership structure of Seibu Railways, one of his companies. Under Japanese stock market rules, no listed company can be more than 80% owned by its 10 largest shareholders. Now Mr Tsutsumi faces criminal charges and the possibility of a prison sentence because he made it look as if the 10 biggest shareholders owned less than this amount. Seibu Railways has been delisted from the stock exchange, its share value has plunged and it is the target of a takeover bid.\\n\\nMr Tsutsumi\\'s fall from grace follows the arrests of several other top executives in Japan as the authorities try to curb the murky business practices which were once widespread in Japanese companies. His determination to stay at the top at all costs may have had its roots in his childhood. The illegitimate third son of a rich father, who made his money buying up property as Japan rebuilt after World War II, he has described the demands his father made. \"I felt enormous pressure when I dined with him and it was nothing but pain,\" Tsutsumi told a weekly magazine in 1987. \"He scolded me for pouring too much soy sauce or told me fruit was not for children. He didn\\'t let me use the silk futon, saying it\\'s a luxury.\" There have been corporate governance issues at some other Japanese companies too. Last year, twelve managers from Mitsubishi Motors were charged with covering up safety defects in their vehicles and three executives from Japan\\'s troubled UFJ bank were charged with concealing the extent of the bank\\'s bad loans.\\n',\n",

If confirmed, that would be the best quarterly showing since early 2002. It leaves GDP up 2.3% for the full year, but short of the 2.5% which the French government had predicted.\\n\\nDespite the apparent shortfall in annual economic growth, the good quarterly figures - a so-called \"flash estimate\" - mark a continuing trend of improving indicators for the health of the French economy. The government is reiterating a 2.5% target for 2005, while the European Central Bank is making positive noises for the 12-nation eurozone as a whole. Also on Friday, France\\'s industrial output for December was released, showing 0.7% growth. \"The numbers are good,\" said David Naude, economist at Deutsche Bank. \"They send a positive signal of a rebound in output... and open the way for a continuation in that trend into the New Year.\" Service sector activity improved in January, hitting a seven-month high.

Mr Fisher has received 39 bids so far, with the largest bid currently at more than $322 (Â£171). \"The winner will be able to send me a tattoo or have me go to a tattoo parlour and get a temporary ink tattoo on my forehead and this will be something they choose, a company name or domain name, perhaps their logo,\" he told the Radio 4 programme.\\n\\nOn the online auction, Mr Fisher describes himself as an \"average American Joe, give or take\". His sales pitch adds: \"Take advantage of this radical advertising campaign and become a part of history.\" Mr Fisher said that while he would accept any brand name or logo, \"I wouldn\\'t go around with a swastika or anything racial\". He added: \"I wouldn\\'t go around with 666, the mark of the beast. \"Other than that I wouldn\\'t promote anything socially unacceptable such as adult websites or stores.\" He said he would use the money to pay college - he is planning to study graphic design.

       " 'Internet boom for gift shopping\\n\\nCyberspace is becoming a very popular destination for Christmas shoppers.\\n\\nForecasts predict that British people will spend Â£4bn buying gifts online during the festive season, an increase of 64% on 2003. Surveys also show that the average amount that people are spending is rising, as is the range of goods that they are happy to buy online. Savvy shoppers are also using the net to find the hot presents that are all but sold out in High Street stores.\\n\\nAlmost half of the UK population now shop online according to figures collected by the Interactive Media in Retail Group which represents web retailers. About 85% of this group, 18m people, expect to do a lot of their Christmas gift buying online this year, reports the industry group. On average each shopper will spend Â£220 and Britons lead Europe in their affection for online shopping.\\n\\nAlmost a third of all the money spent online this Christmas will come out of British wallets and purses compared to 29% from German shoppers and only 4% from Italian gift buyers. James Roper, director of the IMRG, said shoppers were now much happier to buy so-called big ticket items such as LCD television sets and digital cameras. Mr Roper added that many retailers were working hard to reassure consumers that online shopping was safe and that goods ordered as presents would arrive in time for Christmas. He advised consumers to give shops a little more time than usual to fulfil orders given that online buying is proving so popular. A survey by Hostway suggests that many men prefer to shop online to avoid the embarrassment of buying some types of presents, such as lingerie, for wives and girlfriends. Much of this online shopping is likely to be done during work time, according to research carried out by security firm Saint Bernard Software. The research reveals that up to two working days will be lost by staff who do their shopping via their work computer. Worst offenders will be those in the 18-35 age bracket, suggests the research, who will spend up to five hours per week in December browsing and buying at online shops.\\n\\nIggy Fanlo, chief revenue officer at Shopping.com, said that the growing numbers of people using broadband was driving interest in online shopping. \"When you consider narrowband and broadband the conversion to sale is two times higher,\" he said. Higher speeds meant that everything happened much faster, he said, which let people spend time browsing and finding out about products before they buy.\\n\\nThe behaviour of online shoppers was also changing, he said. \"The single biggest reason people went online before this year was price,\" he said. \"The number one reason now is convenience.\" \"Very few consumers click on the lowest price,\" he said. \"They are looking for good prices and merchant reliability.\" Consumer comments and reviews were also proving popular with shoppers keen to find out who had the most reliable customer service. Data collected by eBay suggests that some smart shoppers are getting round the shortages of hot presents by buying them direct through the auction site. According to eBay UK there are now more than 150 Robosapiens remote control robots for sale via the site. The Robosapiens toy is almost impossible to find in online and offline stores. Similarly many shoppers are turning to eBay to help them get hold of the hard-to-find slimline PlayStation 2, which many retailers are only selling as part of an expensive bundle. The high demand for the PlayStation 2 has meant that prices for it are being driven up. In shops the PS2 is supposed to sell for Â£104.99. In some eBay UK auctions the price has risen to more than double this figure. Many people are also using eBay to get hold of gadgets not even released in this country. The portable version of the PlayStation has only just gone on sale in Japan yet some enterprising eBay users are selling the device to UK gadget fans.\\n',\n",
       " 'Halo 2 heralds traffic explosion\\n\\nThe growing popularity of online gaming could spell problems for net service firms, warns network monitoring company Sandvine.\\n\\nIt issued the warning following analysis which shows that traffic on the Xbox game network increased fourfold on the launch day of Halo 2. The 9 November traffic explosion has continued into December, said Sandvine. Service providers now need to make sure that their networks can cope with the increasing demands for bandwidth. As well as being a popular single-player title, Halo 2 can be connected to Microsoft\\'s subscription-based broadband network, Xbox Live. Gamers who want to play online can create their own clan, or team, and take on others to see how well they compare.\\n\\nBut the surge in numbers and huge demands for bandwidth should be a wake-up call to the industry which must ensure that their networks can cope with the increases in traffic, said Sandvine\\'s chief technology officer Marc Morin.\\n\\nIn a bid to cope and ease congestion, providers are increasingly making their networks intelligent, finding out who is using bandwidth and for what. It could become common to charge people for the amount of bandwidth they use. \"The explosion in Xbox Live traffic attributed to Halo 2 should be seen as a clarion call,\" he said. \"ISPs need to enhance the broadband experience for these high-end users by prioritising or reserving bandwidth for games,\" he added.\\n\\nOne of the main factors that spoils online gaming is \"lag\" in which there is a noticeable delay between a gamer clicking on a mouse or keyboard and what happens in the online gaming world. Gamers tend to migrate toward networks with the lowest \"lag\". Analysing traffic will become increasingly important for service providers if they are to hold on to bandwidth-hungry gamers said Lindsay Schroth, an analyst with research firm The Yankee Group. \"In the competitive broadband environment, operators need to differentiate the way they offer access to services like live-play gaming,\" she said. In countries such as Korea, which has high levels of fast net connections to homes, online gaming is hugely popular.\\n',\n",

The aim is to overcome some of the huge logistical challenges in getting supplies to where they are needed. Respond is using satellite imagery to produce accurate maps that can be used in the field rapidly. \"Respond has produced very detailed maps for example for the road networks, for the rivers and for the villages, to more large-scale maps useful for very general planning purposes,\" said Einar Bjorgo from Unosat, the UN satellite mapping organisation that is part of the Respond consortium.\\n\\nThe group uses satellites from Nasa, the European Space Agency and the Disaster Monitoring Constellation. The satellite data is transmitted to ground stations. From there, the information makes its way to Respond organisations that specialise in interpreting such data. \"You have to convert the data into images, then the interpreter has to convert all this into crisis, damage, or situation maps,\" said Stefan Voigt, who works in the remote sensing department of one of those organisations, the German Aerospace Centre.\\n\\nThis kind of detailed analysis usually takes a couple of months but Respond gets it done in about 12 hours. \"Our users are usually not so much familiar with reading satellite imagery, reading satellite maps, so it\\'s our task to transfer the data into information that non-technical people can read and understand easily and very, very efficiently,\" said Mr Voigt. Respond supplies maps to aid groups via the web, and on compact disc. But the best map is one you can hold in your hands, especially in remote areas where internet connections and laptops are scarce. \"A map is a working document,\" explains Herbert Hansen of Respond\\'s Belgian partner Keyobs. \"You need to use it, you need to write on it, correct, give feedback and so on, so you need paper to write on. \"We print maps, we laminate the maps, we encapsulate the maps if needed so you can take a shower with the map, it\\'s completely protected.\"\\n\\nHumanitarian groups in Darfur have been making good use of Respond\\'s maps. They have come in especially handy during Sudan\\'s rainy season, when normally dry riverbeds, or wadis, became flooded. \"These wadis had a very small amount of flooding, generally, in terms of depth, but greatly impeded the transport capabilities and capacities of the humanitarian groups on the ground,\" says Stephen Candillon of Respond imaging partner Sertit. Respond\\'s rapid imaging has allowed aid groups to find ways around the wadis, allowing then to mark on their maps which roads were washed out at which times. Aid groups say that combination of satellite technology and on-the-ground observation helped keep relief flowing to those who needed it.\\n\\nClark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production\\n',\n",

Advisors Goldman Sachs are understood to have valued its demerged Deluxe Film unit at Â£300m, the report added. Speculation of a possible shake-up has mounted since Rank announced a study into a possible demerger in September. Since Mike Smith's appointment as chief executive in 1999, the group has focused on fewer businesses and embarked on a major cost-cutting programme which has seen it dispose of a number of businesses, including the Odeon cinema chain and the Pinewood studios. The move left the group with three core divisions: gaming, Hard Rock and Deluxe Films, which provides technical services to Hollywood studios.\\n\\nRank now aims to concentrate on its gaming, bars and hotels business, including extending its Hard Rock brand to its casinos - trials of which have been a success. It also owns Deluxe Media, which makes and distributes DVDs and videos. However, that business is seen as less successful. Last year it made profits of Â£21.5m on a turnover of Â£392.1m and experts suggest its success in moving to DVDs from VHS video could make it an attractive target for a private equity buyer. A spokesman for the firm refused to comment on the reports, but said any results from the demerger study were likely to be set out when it unveiled its results on Friday. Analysts predict the firm is likely to report a slight drop in annual pre-tax profits to Â£170m from Â£194m last year. Formed in the 1940s the firm was a leading UK film producer and cinema owner for many years. It has now diversified into a range of other leisure activities - mainly in the UK - including hotels, roadside service areas and holiday centres. It now owns 34 Grosvenor casinos, the Mecca Bingo chain and more than 100 Hard Rock Cafes in 38 countries.\\n\",\n",

Good rains, increased use of fertilizers and improved seeds contributed to the rise in production. Nevertheless, 2.2 million Ethiopians will still need emergency assistance.\\n\\nThe report calculated emergency food requirements for 2005 to be 387,500 tonnes. On top of that, 89,000 tonnes of fortified blended food and vegetable oil for \"targeted supplementary food distributions for a survival programme for children under five and pregnant and lactating women\" will be needed.\\n\\nIn eastern and southern Ethiopia, a prolonged drought has killed crops and drained wells. Last year, a total of 965,000 tonnes of food assistance was needed to help seven million Ethiopians. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) recommend that the food assistance is bought locally. \"Local purchase of cereals for food assistance programmes is recommended as far as possible, so as to assist domestic markets and farmers,\" said Henri Josserand, chief of FAO\\'s Global Information and Early Warning System.

They are one of the major clubs in Europe and the pressure will be on Barcelona.\" Chelsea have not played Barcelona since that quarter-final tie five years ago. The Blues had looked destined to progress after winning the first leg at Stamford Bridge 3-1, courtesy of two goals from Tore Andre Flo and one by Gianfranco Zola. But they collapsed in the second leg, going down to strikes from Rivaldo (2), Luis Figo, Dani and Patrick Kluivert.\\n\\nFormer Chelsea captain Desailly, who is now playing for Al-Gharafa in Qatar, says there is no comparison between that side and the current Blues team, who are top of the Premiership. \"Mentally they are much stronger, even though a lot of their players are young,\" the 36-year-old said. \"We made some mistakes at the Nou Camp in 2000 - a lot of them were individual mistakes. \"It would not happen now.

Desailly says the Russian\\'s arrival helped to instil a winning mentality at the club as well as a demand for success. \"The whole of Chelsea is different now - the chairman, the manager and all the players,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Everything is new and there is a huge determination to win. \"Since that game in 2000, Chelsea have gained more experience in Europe and were very close to reaching the Champions League final last season.\" Desailly is one of the most decorated players in the history of football.

So he is full of admiration for two of his colleagues from the great Milan side of the mid-90s who are likely to line up against Manchester United on Wednesday - Paolo Maldini and Alessandro Costacurta. \"I\\'m happy that they have managed to play so long at a high level,\" he said. \"I made a vow to Costacurta that as long as he plays, I will continue to play. \"And it\\'s amazing that Paolo has managed to play at such a high level for such a long time.\"\\n',\n",

He had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration. The Lib Dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next Monday.\\n\\nTory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the ID card scheme. Among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members David Davis, Oliver Letwin and Tim Yeo. But Mr Howard denied Mr Yeo, his transport and environment spokesman, said the plans \"stink\". He also said he was confident shadow home secretary Mr Davis would \"set out the position very clearly\" when he stands up to debate the matter next week. Mr Howard said the police had said ID cards could \"help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives\". He added: \"When the police say that you have to take them seriously\".\\n\\nHe acknowledged there were \"good libertarian arguments\" against the cards, but said the shadow Cabinet had weighed up all the \"conflicting interests\" before reaching its decision. \"I don\\'t pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken.\" He also denied he was afraid of looking \"soft\" on the issue, compared to Labour. The Conservatives announced their support for the government plans on Monday evening.\\n\\nSources within the party told the BBC Mr Howard had always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary. But the Tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.\\n\\nThey said they would also press Labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the Home Office would be able to deliver them. And they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of ID cards and whether people\\'s privacy would be properly protected. \"It is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect,\" a spokesman said. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten has branded the ID scheme a waste of money and \"deeply flawed\". He said: \"This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues\\' concerns over ID cards.\"\\n\\nThe chairman of the Bar Council, Guy Mansfield QC warned there was a real risk that people on the \"margins of society\" would be driven into the hands of extremists. \"What is going to happen to young Asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere? They are going to be stopped. If they haven\\'t [ID cards] they are going to be detained.\" Tory ex-minister Douglas Hogg said he opposed the plans for ID cards branding them a \"regressive\" step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits. He predicted ultimately carrying the cards would become compulsory and that would lead to large numbers of Britain\\'s ethnic minorities being stopped by police.\\n',\n",

I am always confident and we must be positive.\"\\n\\nBenitez defended goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek, whose failure to hold on to Dimitar Berbatov\\'s weak drive allowed Franca to score with the last kick of the game - and give the German team a lifeline for the second leg. \"For me it was not Jerzy Dudek\\'s fault,\" added Benitez. \"He had played a very good game - and had we scored our other chances, nobody would be talking about about their goal. It would not have mattered. \"If we had scored our other chances it would not have been worth remembering that last goal. \"In my opinion Jerzy played well, made two very fine saves - and I am happy with him. \"If we lose 2-0 we are out but I think we can score in Germany - certainly one, and that will make all the difference.\" And the Liverpool boss is looking forward to having skipper Steven Gerrard, who was suspended for the Anfield leg, back for the return in Germany.\\n\\n\"Steven Gerrard is a key player for us,\" said Benitez. \"When he is on the pitch he makes everyone else play better - and the opposition pay special attention to him - which gives space for others. \"Steven is one of the best players in the world, but I need a team that is not about just one player.

About 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed by Hutu militias after the assassination of an ethnic Hutu leader. The five-year Department for International Development funding will enable more survivors to have access to anti-retroviral treatment.\\n\\nThe plight of the infected women was overshadowed for a long time. It was overshadowed by Rwanda's emergence from the 100 days of slaughter, during which time the mass killings took place, and the women's fate was largely a taboo subject.

Until recently, very few of the women have had access to anti-retroviral treatment. That is now starting to change. This funding is intended to make anti-retrovirals and other care available for some 2,500 women.

He objected to subsidies on agriculture that make it hard for developing nations like India to compete. He also called for reform of the United Nations, the World Bank and the IMF.\\n\\nPalaniappan Chidambaram, India\\'s finance minister, argued that these organisations need to take into account the changing world order, given India and China\\'s integration into the global economy. He said the issue is not globalisation but \"the terms of engagement in globalisation.\" Mr Chidambaram is attending the G7 meeting as part of the G20 group of nations, which account for two thirds of the world\\'s population. At a conference on developing enterprise hosted by UK finance minister Gordon Brown on Friday, he said that he was in favour of floating exchange rates because they help countries cope with economic shocks. \"A flexible exchange rate is one more channel for absorbing both positive and negative shocks,\" he told the conference. India, along with China, Brazil, South Africa and Russia, has been invited to take part in the G7 meeting taking place in London on Friday and Saturday. China is expected to face renewed pressure to abandon its fixed exchange rate, which G7 nations, in particular the US, have blamed for a surge in cheap Chinese exports. \"Some countries have tried to use fixed exchange rates. I do not wish to make any judgements,\" Mr Chidambaram said. Separately, the IMF warned on Thursday that India\\'s budget deficit was too large and would hamper the country\\'s economic growth, which it forecast to be around 6.5% in the year to March 2005. In the year to March 2004, the Indian economy grew by 8.5%.\\n',\n",
       " 'Call centre users \\'lose patience\\'\\n\\nCustomers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up, a survey suggests.\\n\\nOnce past the welcome message, callers on average hang up after just 65 seconds of listening to canned music. The drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of 20% every year. \"Customers are getting used to the idea of an \\'always available\\' society,\" says Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned the survey. However, call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls, she says, from just over 5% in 2003 to a record 13.3% during last year. When automated phone message systems are taken out of the equation, where customers have to pick their way through multiple options and messages, the number of abandoned calls is even higher - a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait. One possible reason for the lack in patience, Ms Diemont says, is the fact that more customers are calling \\'on the move\\' using their mobile phones.\\n\\nThe surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres\\' growing range of tasks. \"Once a call centre may have looked after mortgages, now its agents may also be responsible for credit cards, insurance and current accounts,\" Ms Diemont says. Problems are occurring because increased responsibility is not going hand-in-hand with more training, the survey found.\\n\\nIn what Dimension Data calls an \"alarming development\", the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from 36 to just 21 days, leaving \"agents not equipped to deal with customers\". This, Ms Diemont warns, is \"scary\" and not good for the bottom line either. Poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers. As a result, call centres have a high \"churn rate\", with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year, which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff. Resolution rates - the number of calls where a customer\\'s query is resolved to mutual satisfaction - are running at just 50%. When the query is passed on to a second or third person - a specialist or manager - rates rise to about 70%, but that is still well below the industry target of an 85% resolution rate.\\n\\nSuggestions that \"outsourcing\" - relocating call centres to low-cost countries like India or South Africa - is to blame are wrong, Ms Diemont says.\\n\\nThere are \"no big differences in wait time and call resolution\" between call centres based in Europe or North America and those in developing countries around the world. \"You can make call centres perform anywhere if you have good management and the right processes in place,\" she says. However, companies that decide to \"offshore\" their operations are driven not just by cost considerations. Only 42% of them say that saving money is the main consideration when closing domestic call centre operations. Half of them argue that workers in other countries offer better skills for the money. But not everybody believes that outsourcing and offshoring are the solution. Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey have no plans to offshore their call centres. They give three key reasons for not making the move:\\n\\n- call centre operations are part of their business \"core function\", \\n - they are worried about the risk of going abroad, \\n - they fear that they will damage their brand if they join the offshoring drive. The survey was conducted by Sunovate on behalf of Dimension Data, and is based on in-depth questionnaires of 166 call centres in 24 countries and five continents. What are your experiences with call centres? Are you happy to listen to Vivaldi or Greensleeves, or do you want an immediate response? And if you work in a call centre: did your training prepare you for your job?\\n',\n",

But Rover told BBC News that reports of job cuts were \"speculation\". A tie-up, seen as Rover\\'s last chance to save its Longbridge plant, has been pushed by UK Chancellor Gordon Brown. Rover confirmed the tie-up would take place \"not very far away from this time\".\\n\\nRover bosses have said they are \"confident\" the Â£1bn ($1.9bn) investment deal would be signed in March or early April.\\n\\nTransport & General Worker\\'s Union general secretary Tony Woodley repeated his view on Friday that all mergers led to some job cuts.

       " 'Media gadgets get moving\\n\\nPocket-sized devices that let people carry around video and images are set to have a big year in 2005, according to industry experts.\\n\\nLast year saw the emergence of portable media players, such as the Windows-based Creative Zen portable media player, the Samsung Yepp, the iRiver PMC-100, and the Archos AV400 series among others. But this year, they are set to get smarter and more connected, to allow people to find more video to watch on them. Archos launched its latest range of its Linux-based portable media devices at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Friday. Dubbed the Pocket Media Assistant PMA430, it crucially has wi-fi capability built-in for the first time. \"Consumers are showing a great thirst for devices that store all their media in one place for anywhere access,\" said Henri Crohas, chief of Archos. \"And now those consumers can stay connected and productive at the same time.\" Archos said the focus for the device is to be the second gadget in people\\'s pockets, after the mobile.\\n\\nUnlike Windows-based players, the Archos AV400 series devices have always been able to record from any video source, such as TVs, as well as playback. The content put onto the devices is copy protected so cannot then be swapped to another device.\\n\\nRecording is perhaps a crucial functionality for those who have not seen the point of portable video if there is not a lot of video to watch on it. And wi-fi connectivity opens up the possibility of content delivery via a high-speed wireless link. Archos also announced that it would open up the software development kit to Linux developers so that more applications could be created for the device. Microsoft also made some announcements in the portable media arena at CES, primarily for US consumers though. It has agreed a content deal with personal video recorder company TiVo, which Bill Gates also showcased in his keynote speech at CES. The TiVo To Go service means that US consumers will be able to take any programmes they record on their TiVos and transfer it for free to watch on any of the Windows-based portable media players or smartphones. It also said it had launched a service with MTV to let people watch Comedy Central, VH1 and Country Music TV on its devices. And a service is launching with MSN to provide people with shortened versions of news, entertainment and other video on a subscription basis for download via the PC onto the portable devices. But the ability to record directly from TV, VCR, and digital cable and satellite boxes, which Windows-based devices do not offer, certainly gives people more content to watch on the go too.\\n\\nThe increased capability of these devices, and the content deals that are being done, may go some way to persuading people to use them. Recent research by Jupiter suggested that people would prefer a device that was dedicated to music. Only 13% of Europeans wanted to watch video while on the move. More seemed interested in spending their cash on music-only devices.\\n\\n\"This year, we are ready for an explosion of portable media,\" Microsoft\\'s Mike Coleman told the BBC News website. \"We are very bullish about it. The fact that I can put photos on here too and share them is super-cool to the consumer,\" he added. The fact that Europeans are far larger public transport users than Americans is one reason why portable media will take off in the coming year too. There is a burgeoning market there for commuters to watch news and other programmes on their way to work. Although Microsoft\\'s content distribution deals are for the US market at the moment, talks were \"always on-going\" with European content suppliers to offer similar services. Various rights management issues have to be ironed out first however. But that does not prevent people from finding ways to create their own content to share online and swap on portable devices, particularly via those which are wi-fi enabled. The possibility is open for non-professional makers of video and audio to take advantage of the growing portable media market to distribute their work. CES, which runs from 6 to 9 January, showcases more than 50,000 new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in 2005.\\n',\n",

As more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive, the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access, it predicts.\\n\\nThe gap between \"have-nets\" and \"have-nots\" has been much talked about, but predictions about how such a divide will affect future generations has been less discussed. BT set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing. Optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark, the report suggests. \"Internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it,\" said Adrian Hosford, director of corporate responsibility at BT. Costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological. \"There is a hard rump of have-nots who are not engaging with the net. They don\\'t have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits,\" said Mr Hosford.\\n\\nAs now, the most disadvantaged groups are likely to remain among low income families, the older generation and the disabled.\\n\\nThose on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots, the disabled will make up 16% and the elderly nearly a third by 2025, the report forecasts. Organisations such as BT have a responsibility to help tackle the problem, said Mr Hosford. The telco has seen positive results with its Everybody Online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around Britain. In one area of Cornwall with high levels of unemployment, online training helped people rewrite CVs and learn skills to get new jobs, explained Mr Hosford. Such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome, he said. \"If we don\\'t address this problem now, it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs, education opportunities will be limited and they\\'ll simply not be able to keep up with society,\" he said. The Alliance for Digital Inclusion, an independent body with members drawn from government, industry and the voluntary sector has recently been set up to tackle some of the issues faced by the digital refuseniks.\\n',\n",

       " 'Soaring oil \\'hits world economy\\'\\n\\nThe soaring cost of oil has hit global economic growth, although world\\'s major economies should weather the storm of price rises, according to the OECD.\\n\\nIn its latest bi-annual report, the OECD cut its growth predictions for the world\\'s main industrialised regions. US growth would reach 4.4% in 2004, but fall to 3.3% next year from a previous estimate of 3.7%, the OECD said. However, the Paris-based economics think tank said it believed the global economy could still regain momentum.\\n\\nForecasts for Japanese growth were also scaled back to 4.0% from 4.4% this year and 2.1% from 2.8% in 2005. But the outlook was worst for the 12-member eurozone bloc, with already sluggish growth forecasts slipping to 1.8% from 2.0% this year and 1.9% from 2.4% in 2005, the OECD said. Overall, the report forecast total growth of 3.6% in 2004 for the 30 member countries of the OECD, slipping to 2.9% next year before recovering to 3.1% in 2006. \"There are nonetheless good reasons to believe that despite recent oil price turbulence the world economy will regain momentum in a not-too-distant future,\" said Jean-Philippe Cotis, the OECD\\'s chief economist. The price of crude is about 50% higher than it was at the start of 2004, but down on the record high of $55.67 set in late October.\\n\\nA dip in oil prices and improving jobs prospects would improve consumer confidence and spending, the OECD said. \"The oil shock is not enormous by historical standards - we have seen worse in the seventies. If the oil price does not rise any further, then we think the shock can be absorbed within the next few quarters,\" Vincent Koen, a senior economist with the OECD, told the BBC\\'s World Business Report. \"The recovery that was underway, and has been interrupted a bit by the oil shock this year, would then regain momentum in the course of 2005.\" China\\'s booming economy and a \"spectacular comeback\" in Japan - albeit one that has faltered in recent months - would help world economic recovery, the OECD said. \"Supported by strong balance sheets and high profits, the recovery of business investment should continue in North America and start in earnest in Europe,\" it added. However, the report warned: \"It remains to be seen whether continental Europe will play a strong supportive role through a marked upswing of final domestic demand.\" The OECD highlighted current depressed household expenditure in Germany and the eurozone\\'s over-reliance on export-led growth.\\n',\n",

The deficit with China, up 30.5% at $162bn, was the largest ever recorded with a single country. However, on a monthly basis the US trade gap narrowed by 4.9% in December to Â£56.4bn. The US consumer\\'s appetite for all things from oil to imported cars, and even wine and cheese, reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of President Bush\\'s economic policies.\\n\\nDemocrats claim the administration has not done enough to clamp down on unfair foreign trade practices. For example, they believe China\\'s currency policy - which US manufacturers claim has undervalued the yuan by as much as 40% - has given China\\'s rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against US competitors.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Bush administration argues that the US deficit reflects the fact the America is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world, spurring on more demand for imported goods. Some economists say this may allow an upward revision of US economic growth in the fourth quarter. But others point out that the deficit has reached such astronomical proportions that foreigners many choose not to hold as many dollar-denominated assets, which may in turn harm growth. For all of 2004, US exports rose 12.3% to $1.15 trillion, but imports rose even faster by 16.3% to a new record of $1.76 trillion. Foreign oil exports surged by 35.7% to a record $180.7bn, reflecting the rally in global oil prices and increasing domestic demand. Imports were not affected by the dollar\\'s weakness last year. \"We expect the deficit to continue to widen in 2005 even if the dollar gets back to its downward trend,\" said economist Marie-Pierre Ripert at IXIS.\\n',\n",

Celtic are in no position to match Birmingham\\'s Â£6m offer but a stay until the end of the season could suit Bellamy while he considers his future.

But they\\'ve not been beaten in the competition by a club outside the Premiership for nine years, since Ipswich - then in the second tier - defeated them 0-1 after extra time in a third round replay at Ewood Park on 16 January 1996. History is on Rovers side. When they last met their near neighbours in the FA Cup 45 years ago, it also required an Ewood Park replay, which the home side won 2-0, and when they last met in the League, Rovers did the double. They first won their Nationwide Division One trip to Turf Moor 0-2 four seasons ago, and then thrashed the Clarets on home soil 5-0. \\n - Manager Mark Hughes, who won the Cup four times as a player, is aiming to steer Rovers into the quarter-finals for the second time in 12 years, and first time since the 2000/2001 season. Success here, and victory home to Leicester in the next round, could see Rovers in the semi-finals without having played Premiership opposition. \\n - BURNLEY make the eight mile journey to their fierce rivals, determined to send Blackburn the same way as Liverpool in the third round. But having failed to pull off another shock at Turf Moor, it could be that the Championship outfit - 17 places inferior on the League ladder - have missed their best opportunity. Having said that, Burnley are yet to concede a goal in this Cup run. \\n - Steve Cotterills\\' Clarets have been knocked out in the fifth round four times in the last seven years, and have made only one appearance in the sixth round in 21 years. That was in the season before last, when they disposed of Premiership Fulham at this fifth round stage. \\n - While Blackburn have not played since the fifth round tie, Burnley have had two League outings away from home, drawing 1-1 at Derby and losing 1-0 at Preston.

Yukos claimed it sought help in the US because other forums - Russian courts and the European Court of Human Rights - were either unfriendly or offered less protection. Russia had indicated it would in any case not abide by the rulings of the US courts.\\n\\nIn her ruling, the judge acknowledged that \"it appears likely that agencies of the Russian government have acted in a manner that would be considered confiscatory under United States law\".

The US court\\'s jurisdiction had been challenged by Deutsche Bank and Gazpromneft, a former unit of Russian gas monopoly Gazprom which is due to merge with Rosneft.

More than a third of respondents said they were concerned that spam e-mails contained viruses or programs that attempted to collect personal information. \"Both industry and the media have helped to raise awareness of the issues that surround illegitimate e-mail, helping to reduce the potential financial damage and nuisance from phishing attacks and spoof websites,\" said William Plante, director of corporate security and fraud protection at security firm Symantec. \"At the same time, consumers need to continue exercising caution and protect themselves from harm with a mixture of spam filters, spyware detection software and sound judgement.\"\\n',\n",
       " \"2D Metal Slug offers retro fun\\n\\nLike some drill sergeant from the past, Metal Slug 3 is a wake-up call to today's gamers molly-coddled with slick visuals and fancy trimmings.\\n\\nWith its hand-animated sprites and 2D side-scrolling, this was even considered retro when released in arcades four years ago. But a more frantic shooter you will not find at the end of your joypad this year. And yes, that includes Halo 2. Simply choose your grunt and wade through five 2D side-scrolling levels of the most hectic video game blasting you will ever encounter. It is also the toughest game you are likely to play, as hordes of enemies and few lives pile the pressure on.\\n\\nPlayers must battle soldiers, snowmen, zombies, giant crabs and aliens, not to mention the huge, screen-filling bosses that guard each of the five levels.\\n\\nThe shoot-anything-that-moves gameplay is peppered with moments of old-school genius. Fans of robotic gastropods should note the title refers, instead, to the vast array of vehicles on offer in a game stuffed with bizarre hardware. Tanks, jets and submarines can be commandeered, as well as cannon-toting camels, elephants and ostriches - more weaponry on offer than in an acre of Iraq. Doling out justice is a joy thanks to ultra responsive controls, and while this is a tough nut to crack, it is addictive enough to have you gagging for that one last go. And at a mere Â£20, Metal Slug 3 is as cheap as sliced, fried spuds, as the man says. Of course, most of you will ignore this, lacking as it does the visual fireworks of modern blasters. But at a time when blockbuster titles offer only a fresh lick of paint in favour of real innovation, Metal Slug 3 is a fresh gasp of air from an era when the Xbox was not even a twinkle in Bill Gates' eye.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Disney backs Sony DVD technology\\n\\nA next generation DVD technology backed by Sony has received a major boost.\\n\\nFilm giant Disney says it will produce its future DVDs using Sony's Blu-ray Disc technology, but has not ruled out a rival format developed by Toshiba. The two competing DVD formats, Blu-ray developed by Sony and others, and Toshiba's HD-DVD, have been courting top film studios for several months. The next generation of DVDs promise very high quality pictures and sound, as well as a lot of data. Both technologies use a blue laser to write information. It has a shorter wavelength so more data can be stored. Disney is the latest studio to announce which technology it is backing in a format battle which mirrors the 1980s Betamax versus VHS war. Sony lost out to JVC in that fight.\\n\\nThe current battle for Hollywood's hearts and minds is a crucial one because high-definition films will bring in billions of revenue and the studios would prefer to use one standard. Last month, Paramount, Universal and Warner Brothers said they were opting for the Toshiba and NEC-backed format, HD-DVD high-definition discs.\\n\\nThose studios currently produce about 45% of DVD content. Sony Pictures Entertainment and MGM Studios have already staked their allegiance with the Blu-ray Disc Association, whose members also include technology companies Dell, Samsung and Matsushita. Twentieth Century Fox is still to announce which technology it will be supporting. If Fox decided to go with Blu-ray too, it would mean the format would have a 47% share of DVD content. Disney said its films would be available on the Blu-ray format when DVD players for the standard went on sale on North America and Japan, expected in 2006. Universal is to start producing films on the HD-DVD format in 2005, and Paramount will start releasing titles using the standard in 2006. Toshiba expects sales of HD-DVDs to reach 300bn yen ($2.9bn, Â£1.5bn) by 2010.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Lifestyle \\'governs mobile choice\\'\\n\\nFaster, better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets, research suggests.\\n\\nInstead, phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake. Consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size, onboard memory or the chip inside, shows an in-depth study by telecommunications company Ericsson. \"Historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology,\" said Dr Michael Bjorn, senior advisor on mobile media at Ericsson\\'s consumer and enterprise lab. \"We have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives,\" he said. \"We should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing,\" he told the BBC News website.\\n\\nFor the study, Ericsson interviewed 14,000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone. \"People\\'s habits remain the same,\" said Dr Bjorn. \"They just move the activity into the mobile phone as it\\'s a much more convenient way to do it.\"\\n\\nOne good example of this was diary-writing among younger people, he said. While diaries have always been popular, a mobile phone -- especially one equipped with a camera -- helps them keep it in a different form. Youngsters\\' use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way. Dr Bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it, the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles. Ericsson\\'s research has shown that consumers divide into different \"tribes\" that use phones in different ways. Dr Bjorn said groups dubbed \"pioneers\" and \"materialists\" were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use. \"For instance,\" he said, \"older people are using SMS much more than they did five years ago.\" This was because younger users, often the children of ageing mobile owners, encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch.\\n\\nAnother factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists. Only when about 25% of people have handsets with new innovations on them, such as cameras, can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it.\\n\\nOnce this significant number of users is passed, use of new innovations tends to take off. Dr Bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in Japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop. However, he said, now 45% of the Japanese people Ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month. In 2003 the figure was 29%. Similarly, across Europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise. In 2003 only 4% of the people in the UK took a phonecam snap at least once a month. Now the figure is 14%. Similar rises have been seen in many other European nations. Dr Bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras. \"Usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras,\" he said. Digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings, holidays and birthdays. By contrast, he said, camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life.\\n',\n",

It follows concerns that children may be playing games aimed at adults which include high levels of violence. In 2003, Britons spent Â£1,152m on games, more than ever before. And this Christmas, parents are expected to spend millions on video games and consoles.\\n\\nViolent games have been hit by controversy after the game Manhunt was blamed by the parents of 14-year-old Stefan Pakeerah, who was stabbed to death in Leicester in February. His mother, Giselle, said her son\\'s killer, Warren Leblanc, 17 - who was jailed for life in September - had mimicked behaviour in the game.\\n\\nPolice investigating Stefan\\'s murder dismissed its influence and said Manhunt was not part of its legal case. The issue of warnings on games for adults was raised on Sunday by Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt. This was the focus of the talks between government officials, representatives from the games industry and the British Board of Film Classification. \"Adults can make informed choices about what games to play. Children can\\'t and they deserve to be protected,\" said Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell after the meeting. \"Industry will consider how to make sure parents know what games their children should and shouldn\\'t play.\" Roger Bennett, director general of Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association, said: \"A number of initiatives were discussed at the meeting. \"They will be formulated to create specific proposals to promote greater understanding, recognition and awareness of the games rating system, ensuring that young people are not exposed to inappropriate content.\"\\n\\nAmong the possible measures could be a campaign to explain to parents that many games are made for an adult audience, as well as changes to the labelling of the games themselves.\\n\\nAccording to industry statistics, a majority of players are over 18, with the average age of a gamer being 29. Academics point out that there has not been any definitive research linking bloodthirsty games such as Manhunt with violent responses in players. In a report published this week for the Video Standards Council, Dr Guy Cumberbatch said: \"The research evidence on media violence causing harm to viewers is wildly exaggerated and does not stand up to scrutiny.\" Dr Cumberbatch, head of the social policy think tank, the Communications Research Group, reviewed the studies on the issue. He concluded that there was an absence of convincing research that media violence caused harm.\\n',\n",

The cash raised will go towards the UK\\'s nuclear clean-up programme. But Lib Dem Norman Baker accused ministers of turning Britain into a \"nuclear dumpsite\".\\n\\nUnder current contracts, British Nuclear Fuels should return all but low level waste, but none has ever been sent back. In future, only highly-radioactive waste will be sent back to its country of origin, normally Germany or Japan, under armed guard. Intermediate waste from countries such as Japan, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Sweden will be stored permanently in the UK. At the moment, this waste is stored at Sellafield, in Cumbria, in the form of glass bricks, untreated liquid waste or solid material in drums. In a statement, the Department of Trade and Industry said the new policy meant there would be a \"sixfold reduction in the number of waste shipments to overseas countries\". And it said highly-radioactive waste would be returned to its home country sooner, ensuring there would be no overall increase in radioactivity.\\n\\nTrade Secretary Patricia Hewitt said the new arrangements, revealed in a Commons written statement, would raise up to Â£680m for Britain\\'s nuclear clean-up programme, under the new Nuclear Decommissioning Agency.

This is because of possible malfunctions with the braking systems. The affected vehicles in the product recall are from the 2004 and 2005 model years, GM said. Those vehicles with potential faults are the Chevrolet Avalanche, Express, Kodiak, Silverade and Suburban; the GMC Savana, Sierra and Yukon.\\n\\nThe NHTSA said a pressure accumulator in the braking system could crack during normal driving and fragments could injure people if the hood was open. This could allow hydraulic fluid to leak, which could make it harder to brake or steer and could cause a crash, it warned. GM is also recalling 19,924 Cadillac XLR coupes, SRX SUVs and Pontiac Grand Prix sedans from the 2004 model year. This is because the accelerator pedal may not work properly in extremely cold temperatures, requiring more braking. In addition, the car giant is calling back 17,815 Buick Raniers, Chevrolet Trailblazers, GMC Envoys and Isuzu Ascenders from the 2005 model years because the windshield is not properly fitted and could fall out in a crash. However, GM stressed that it did not know of any injuries related to the problems. News of the recall follows an announcement last month that GM expects earnings this year be lower than in 2004.

Last month, Paramount, Universal and Warner Brothers said they were opting for the Toshiba and NEC-backed format, HD-DVD high-definition discs.\\n\\nThose studios currently produce about 45% of DVD content. Sony Pictures Entertainment and MGM Studios have already staked their allegiance with the Blu-ray Disc Association, whose members also include technology companies Dell, Samsung and Matsushita. Twentieth Century Fox is still to announce which technology it will be supporting. If Fox decided to go with Blu-ray too, it would mean the format would have a 47% share of DVD content. Disney said its films would be available on the Blu-ray format when DVD players for the standard went on sale on North America and Japan, expected in 2006. Universal is to start producing films on the HD-DVD format in 2005, and Paramount will start releasing titles using the standard in 2006. Toshiba expects sales of HD-DVDs to reach 300bn yen ($2.9bn, Â£1.5bn) by 2010.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Gritty return for Prince of Persia\\n\\nStill basking in the relatively recent glory of last year's Sands Of Time, the dashing Prince of Persia is back in Warrior Within, and in a more bellicose mood than last time.\\n\\nThis sequel gives the franchise a grim, gritty new look and ramps up the action and violence. As before, you control the super-athletic prince from a third-person perspective. The time-travelling plot hinges on the Dahaka, an all-consuming monster pursuing our hero through the ages. The only way to dispel it is to turn back the clock again and kill the sultry Empress Of Time before she ever creates the Sands of Time that caused the great beast's creation.\\n\\nStudiously structured though this back story is, everything boils down to old-fashioned fantasy gameplay which proves, on the whole, as dependable as it needs to be. Ever since the series' then-groundbreaking beginnings on the Commodore Amiga, Prince of Persia has always been about meticulously-animated acrobatic moves, that provide an energetic blend of leaping preposterously between pieces of scenery and lopping off enemies' body parts.\\n\\nThose flashy moves are back in full evidence, and tremendous fun to perform and perfect. Combining them at speed is the best fun, although getting a handle of doing so takes practice and plenty of skill. Until you reach that point, it is a haphazard business. All too often, you will perform a stunning triple somersault, pirouette off a wall, knock out three enemies in one glorious swoop, before plummeting purposefully over a cliff to your doom. That in turn can mean getting set back an annoyingly long distance, for you can only save at the fountains dotted along the path. The expected fiendish puzzles are all present and correct, but combat is what is really been stepped up, and there is more of it than before. The game's developers have combined acrobatic flair with gruesome slaying techniques in some wonderfully imaginative ways. Slicing foes down the middle is one particularly entertaining method of seeing them off.\\n\\nWarrior Within is a very slick package; the game's intro movie is so phenomenally good that it actually does an ultimate disservice once the game itself commences.\\n\\nIt is on a par with the jaw-dropping opening sequence of Onimusha 3 earlier this year, and when the game begins, it is something of an anti-climax. That said, the graphics are excellent, and indeed among the most striking and satisfying elements of the game. The music is probably the worst aspect - a merit-free heavy metal soundtrack that you will swiftly want to turn off. There is something strangely unsatisfying about the game. Perhaps precisely because its graphics and mechanics are so good that the story and overall experience are not quite as engaging as they should be. Somehow it adds up to less than the sum of its parts, and is more technically impressive than it is outright enjoyable. But that is not to say Warrior Within is anything other than a superb adventure that most will thoroughly enjoy. It just does not quite take the character to the new heights that might have been hoped for.\\n\",\n",
       " 'PC photo printers challenge pros\\n\\nHome printed pictures can be cheaper and higher quality than those from High Street developers, tests shows.\\n\\nA survey carried out by PC Pro magazine looked at which of 100 home photo printers offered a better deal than handing your snaps to a photo lab. The tests found that images from top PC printers kept their colour longer than professionally produced photographs. But using the wrong printer cartridge could means snaps fade in months, warned the magazine.\\n\\nThe group test of 100 home photo printers for PCs discovered how much it costs to create images using the devices compared to online developers as well as High Street names such as Jessops, Boots and Snappy Snaps. The comprehensive test also revealed how quickly different printers produced images, the quality of the finished image and how resistant finished pictures were to smudging or water damage. It found that although some ink for printers now costs more than Â£2 per millilitre it can still be cheaper to produce prints from photographs at home than it is to send them off to a High Street store. \"If you really like your photos, then it\\'s definitely worth printing at home instead of going to the high street, but only if you choose the right printer,\" said Nick Ross, top tester at PC Pro.\\n\\nMr Ross said that a new generation of printers produced images with brighter colours and that were less likely to fade than many High Street developers or even some professional wedding photographers. Some High Street photo shops can be the cheapest when it came to developing prints that were 6x4in, said Mr Ross, but the test revealed that images 7x5in and 8x10in in size were cheaper to produce at home. According to PC Pro, producing a print 8x10in on an Epson R800 printer using top quality paper costs Â£1.87. At Jessops the same image would cost Â£2.50 and at Snappy Snaps Â£9.99. A 10x7in snap at Boots would cost Â£4.99. \"Considering how inconvenient it can be to go to the High Street and how silver-halide prints can fade in the sun, we\\'re adamant that it\\'s now better, cheaper and more convenient to print at home,\" he said. Ann Simpson, marketing manager at Snappy Snaps believes the convenience of high street printing will continue to attract customers. \"Some people will want to do their own thing on their computer but the feedback to us is that customers often have to print two or three pictures at home in order to get a good one,\" she said. \"Many people are not skilled at getting the colour, contrast and cropping right and they don\\'t want the hassle,\" she added. The magazine test found that which ink consumers use determined how long their prints lasted before they started fading. It recommended avoiding so-called third-party inks not produced by printer makers because they tended to produce prints that fade the quickest.\\n',\n",

But he is not on the list of producers who can win a best film Oscar due to a limit on the number of nominees. The Oscars organisers have picked two of The Aviator's four producers to be nominated for best film.\\n\\nUp to three producers can be named per film but the studios behind The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby failed to trim their credits - so the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (Ampas) has done it for them. The Aviator's nominated producers are Michael Mann and Graham King - with Mr Evans and Sandy Climan, Mr Mann's former deputy, left off. Mr Evans sued Mr Mann in 2001, claiming he came up with the idea, spent years developing it and persuaded DiCaprio to play Hughes - but said he was later excluded from the project. The two sides settled out of court in a deal that has remained secret apart from the fact Mr Evans' name has appeared as a producer when the film's credits roll. At the Golden Globes, Mr Evans - who was named among the winners when the film won best drama film - evaded a security guard to have his photo taken with DiCaprio, director Martin Scorsese, Mr Mann and Mr King.\\n\\nAmpas decided to limit the number of producers who could be nominated after Shakespeare in Love's victory in 1999 saw five producers collect awards. The eligible names for The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby were decided by Ampas' producers branch executive committee on Wednesday. The decision also saw Clint Eastwood get his third personal nomination for Million Dollar Baby. He is now named in the best film category as well as being nominated for best director and best lead actor. The Academy Awards ceremony will be held in Hollywood on 27 February. Chinese actress Ziyi Zhang, star of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Hero and House of Flying Daggers, is the latest name to be added to the list of presenters on the night.\\n\",\n",

It features the singer talking about both his career and his personal life, from his days in Wham! through to more recent events. Michael will attend the festival to introduce the screening on 16 February. Director Southan Morris and executive producer Andy Stephens will also attend the festival.\\n\\nThe 93 minute film will see Michael discussing his early days in Wham! along with his later career, including his legal battles with record label Sony and his stance against the Iraq war and American politics. It will also touch upon his turbulent personal life, including his arrest in a Beverly Hills park toilet in 1998 for \"lewd behaviour\", and the death of his boyfriend Anselmo Feleppa from Aids. The film, which includes previously unseen footage of the singer also features contributions from Michael\\'s former Wham! partner Andrew Ridgeley, as well as ex-Wham! backing singers Pepsi and Shirlie. Other contributors include Sting, Mariah Carey, Elton John, Noel Gallagher, Geri Halliwell and Simon Cowell. This year\\'s festival will open with Man To Man, a historical epic starring Joseph Fiennes and Kristin Scott-Thomas. It will be one of 21 films competing for the festival\\'s top prize, the Golden Bear.

       " 'Fed chief warning on US deficit\\n\\nFederal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan has warned that allowing huge US budget deficits to continue could have \"severe\" consequences.\\n\\nSpeaking to the House Budget Committee he urged Congress to take action to cut the deficit, such as increasing taxes. While the US economy is growing at a \"reasonably good pace\" he warned that budget concerns were clouding the economic outlook for the US. Pension and healthcare costs posed the greatest risks to the economy, he said.\\n\\nThe government program faces severe financial strains in coming decades as the massive baby-boom generation retires. \"I fear that we may have already committed more physical resources to the baby-boom generation in its retirement years than our economy has the capacity to deliver. If existing promises need to be changed, those changes should be made sooner rather than later,\" Mr Greenspan said. He also warned that unless the nation sees unprecedented rises in productivity \"retirement and health programmes would need \"significant\" changes. He called on Congress to cut promised benefits for retirees, as the promised benefits for the soon-to-retire baby boom generation were much larger than the government could afford.\\n\\nMeanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose a significant risk to the economy by dampening growth and spending, he added. He also urged Congress to reinstate lapsed rules that require tax cuts and spending to be offset elsewhere in the budget in an effort to prevent the US heading further into the red. Despite the dire warnings, Mr Greenspan did offer some good news for the short term. As US growth gathers steam and incomes rise that should lead to a narrowing of the deficit. Recent increases in defence and homeland security spending were also not expected to continue indefinitely, which should cut some costs. Since President George W Bush came to office the federal budget has swung from a record surplus to a record deficit of $412bn last year.\\n',\n",

You'll have forgotten it all tomorrow but you'll have a fun night with the film and all the extras. There is a one-disc version that has commentaries and a Making Of but the two-disc adds more. Unusually for this kind of film, the extras don't solely concentrate on the special effects. They're covered but there's also a general Production Diary and a Post-Production feature.\\n\\nRemember the National Lottery's draw machines Arthur and Guinevere? They were more accurate than this glossy Hollywood version of the tale.\\n\\nBut as long as you're not expecting a documentary, live with it: King Arthur is a fun, exciting, totally shallow experience and looks excellent. Clive Owen is the brooding king, Keira Knightly rises above her costume and Ray Winstone gives it all some grit. It's at its best in its battle scenes which are well done and are also the best part of the Making Of extra.\\n\\nLess flashy than a David Attenborough show and less detailed than a Simon Schama one, the BBC series British Isles nevertheless turned out to be quite engrossing. Admit it, the fact that this is one of the shows Alan Titchmarsh left Ground Force to present did mean that you expected something equally frothy. But Titchmarsh turns out to know his subject and the sight of our present-day landscape being peeled back to reveal the past was fascinating. He's now written an accompanying book, too.\\n\",\n",

Mr Blair insisted he had been \"intimately involved\" in \"all decisions at all times\" despite being abroad. He was speaking before the UK joins a three-minute silence at noon across the EU for the estimated 150,000 dead.\\n\\nThe Foreign Office says 41 Britons are now confirmed to have died in the Tsunami which struck south Asia on Boxing Day, with 158 others missing. Asked about criticism that he did not cut short his holiday, Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme: \"I don\\'t think this is a situation in which the British people need me to articulate what they feel.\\n\\n\"I think they feel - as we all do - shock, horror, and absolute solidarity with those people who have lost their lives.\" The important thing was action and not words, he said, adding that of the Â£50m given by the government so far only \"six or seven million\" had been spent. It would become easier in the coming weeks to assess just how much money would have to be put in. \"My estimate is we will need to spend from government several hundred million pounds. So we will far and away more than match the generosity of the British people,\" he said. Asked whether he had not returned to work immediately because he was under doctors orders to rest, Mr Blair said there was also a story he had been away for plastic surgery. \"As you can see unfortunately I am still looking the same as I always did,\" he joked.\\n\\nThe prime minister took personal charge of the UK\\'s response on Tuesday, chairing a meeting of the emergency committee of ministers that has convened daily since Boxing Day.

But she said the target for an inpatient appointment would remain at 12 months for March 2006. The announcement came as new monthly waiting figures showed a drop. This current inpatient target was set when the assembly government extended its second offer guarantee scheme, which gives patients the option of having their treatment outside Wales.\\n\\nDetails about funding to resource the new targets are expected in the New Year. In England, the current target for inpatients - seeing a consultant to having an operation - is six months. Dr Richard Lewis, Welsh secretary of the British Medical Association (BMA), welcomed the new targets \"to make further and faster progress on waiting lists\". \"However, much remains to be done on waiting lists and waiting times because Wales still lags a long way behind England,\" he said. \"Capacity must be built into the system with sustained investment to ensure that Welsh patients don\\'t receive a worse service than patients over the border.\" Health analyst Tony Beddow, from the Welsh Institute for Health and Social Care, called the new targets \"reasonably impressive\".\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Ms Hutt also announced Â£264m for health services will be spent reducing waiting times, improving key areas and modernising staff pay structures in Wales.\\n\\nMs Hutt said major achievements had been made in cutting \"unacceptably long waits for treatment over the past year\". \"We are turning the corner on long waits in Wales. Now we need to see those reductions in long waiters being improved again,\" she said. She added the targets intended to ensure no-one waits more than a year for treatment or to see a consultant. \"But let us not forget two thirds of those waiting for treatment now are waiting less than six months, and these targets affect the small minority of patients in Wales that are waiting far too long.\" Rhodri Glyn Thomas, Plaid Cymru health spokesman said: \"It\\'s exactly the same target she set in 1999, with the qualification that it\\'s dependent on a second offer. It\\'s a failed target, from a failed minister..with a failed policy.\" For the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Kirsty Williams called the new target \"hugely unambitious\". \"It leaves patients in Wales still waiting two years before they\\'re treated.\" Conservative health spokesman Jonathan Morgan said: \"We\\'re spending more money but waiting lists have gone through the roof. \"The Audit Commission has said that the money is not being spent efficiently or effectively, and that\\'s quite a criticism.\" Meanwhile, the latest monthly waiting list figures showed the total number of people waiting more than 18 months as an inpatient in Wales has fallen by 9.8%. Statistics to the end of November showed a decline since October from 785 to 708. The number waiting over 12 months also fell from 7,613 to 6,630, or 12.9%.

The report suggests 69% of UK firms are now using broadband and that 30% of micro businesses are trading online. Mr O\\'Brien said UK businesses were sprinting forward in ICT use, but that there were more challenges ahead. The report, carried out independently by consultants Booz Allen Hamilton and HI Europe, placed the UK third behind Sweden and Ireland for business use of ICT.\\n\\nIt showed British business brought greater maturity to their ICT use, by using broadband in increased numbers, bringing ICT into their business plans and using new technologies such as voice activated programmes and desktop video conferences. Mr O\\'Brien said: \"The increase in the proportion of business connected by broadband shows that UK companies are embracing the opportunities that ICT can bring. \"It is particularly encouraging to see that small businesses are beginning to narrow the digital divide that appeared to have opened up in recent years.\" The government would play its part in \"cultivating an environment where information and communication technologies can flourish\", Mr O\\'Brien said. The \"clear message\" the report sends is that effective use of ICT can bring real improvements in business performance for all business.\\n\\n\"However, we are not at the finishing line yet and many challenges remain if the UK is to reach its aim of becoming a world-leading e-economy,\" he added.

Chief police officers spokesman Nigel Yeo said he expected most people would obey the law - by drag hunting or chasing foxes then shooting them. He said police would challenge the \"one of two isolated hunts\" which are threatening to break the law.\\n\\nBut Simon Hart of the Countryside Alliance has questioned how police will ensure there are no violations. \"The definitions of legal and illegal hunting are so blurred that the police are being asked to make impossible judgements. \"You can hunt a rat, but not a mouse, a rabbit but not a hare, an artificial scent, but not a real one,\" he said.\\n\\nThe Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, has so far issued no instructions to police on how they should deal with hunters who violate the law. He said he will consult the Director of Public Prosecutions and the police \"in the near future\" to decide what measures to take with regards to hunting prosecutions. He has rejected a \"blanket policy\" of not enforcing the ban until the House of Lords has considered its legality. John Cooper, a barrister and chairman of the League Against Cruel Sports, said the anti-hunting lobby expects the authorities to prosecute wherever there is clear evidence of illegal hunting practices. He said police had \"acknowledged their duty to investigate allegations of hunting offences\".\\n\\nThe Beaufort Hunt had one pack out on Thursday and has promised a hunt this weekend. Under the new law hunters have a number of legal options available to them.\\n\\nAs well as being able to mount a hunt for an artificial scent, it will still be legal for the hunts to \"flush out\" foxes, as long as they shoot their quarry rather than set the hounds on them. \"We are not going away. We will keep these hounds going, we will keep this community going and in the end we will come back and hunt when hunting is legal again,\" hunt master, Captain Ian Farquhar, said. But Tony Banks, Labour MP for West Ham, said the issue would soon disappear, and that \"people in a few years time will be wondering what it was all about\". He said had the government not prevaricated since 1997 in introducing the ban, hunting with dogs would have passed into history like other former country pursuits such as otter hunting and badger baiting. \"Let the election decide this because the Conservatives have made clear that if they get elected into government they will restore hunting,\" he said.\\n',\n",

It hopes 2005 sales will benefit from the launch of a new England replica shirt ahead of the 2006 World Cup. In January, Umbro announced its sponsorship agreement with Chelsea, which gave Umbro the lucrative right to make replica shirts, would end in 2006, five years earlier than expected. The firm, which is to receive a payment from Chelsea of Â£24.5m, said it is \"appraising a number of additional investment opportunities as a result of this compensation\" . Chief executive Peter McGuigan said the firm plans to grow sales both in the UK and internationally.\\n\\nThe firm, reporting its first annual results since listing on the London Stock Exchange in June, said the UK market had seen sales growth of 8% last year. It said the launch of its Evolution X fashion range had boosted sales. Umbro supplies more than 150 teams across the world including the national sides of Ireland, Sweden and Norway. Shares in Umbro were up 1.76% at 115.5 pence in morning trade.\\n',\n",

Julia Roberts won her 10th consecutive crown as favourite female movie star. Johnny Depp was favourite male movie star and Renee Zellweger was favourite leading lady at Sunday\\'s awards in LA.\\n\\nFilm sequel Shrek 2 took three prizes - voted top animated movie, top film comedy and top sequel. In television categories, Desperate Housewives was named top new drama and Joey, starring former Friends actor Matt LeBlanc, was best new comedy. Long-running shows Will and Grace and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation were named best TV comedy and TV drama respectively.\\n\\nNominees for the People\\'s Choice Awards were picked by a 6,000-strong Entertainment Weekly magazine panel, and winners were subsequently chosen by 21 million online voters. Fahrenheit 9/11 director Michael Moore dedicated his trophy to soldiers in Iraq. His film was highly critical of President George W Bush and the US-led invasion of Iraq, and Moore was an outspoken Bush critic in the 2004 presidential campaign inwhich Democratic challenger John Kerry lost.\\n\\n\"This country is still all of ours, not right or left or Democrat or Republican,\" Moore told the audience at the ceremony in Pasadena, California. Moore said it was \"an historic occasion\" that the 31-year-old awards ceremony would name a documentary its best film. Unlike many other film-makers, Passion of the Christ director Mel Gibson has vowed not to campaign for an Oscar for his movie. \"To me, really, this is the ultimate goal because one doesn\\'t make work for the elite,\" Gibson said backstage at the event. \"To me, the people have spoken.\"\\n',\n",

More than a third of all new PCs will be in these markets, with China adding 178 million new PCs by 2010, it said. Low-priced computers made by local companies are expected to dominate in such territories, Forrester said. The report comes less than a week after IBM, a pioneer of the PC business, sold its PC hardware division to China\\'s number one computer maker Lenovo.\\n\\nThe $1.75bn (Â£900m) deal will make the combined operation the third biggest PC vendor in the world. \"Today\\'s products from Western PC vendors won\\'t dominate in those markets in the long term,\" Simon Yates, a senior analyst for Forrester, said. \"Instead local PC makers like Lenovo Group in China and Aquarius in Russia that can better tailor the PC form factor, price point and applications to their local markets will ultimately win the market share battle,\" he said. There are currently 575 million PCs in use globally. The United States, Europe and Asia-Pacific are expected to add 150 million new PCs by 2010, according to the study. The report forecast that there will be 80 million new PC users in India by 2010 and 40 million new users in Indonesia.\\n',\n",
       " 'Set your television to wow\\n\\nTelevision started off as a magical blurry image. Then came the sharpness, the colour and the widescreen format. Now the TV set is taking another leap forward into a crystal clear future, although those in Europe will have to be patient.\\n\\nAfter years of buzz about high-definition TV (HDTV) it is finally taking off in a handful of countries around the world, mainly the US and Japan. If you believe the hype, then HDTV will so wow you, that you will never want to go back to your old telly. \"HDTV is just the latest must-have technology in viewers\\' homes,\" says Jo Flaherty, a senior broadcaster with the CBS network in the US. All television images are made up of pixels, going across the screen, and scan lines going down. British TV pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels. By contrast, HDTV offers up to 1,080 active lines, with each line made up of 1,920 pixels. The result is a picture which can be up to six times as sharp as standard TV. But to get the full impact, programmes need to be broadcast in this format and you need a HDTV set to receive them. Most new computer displays are already capable of handling high-resolution pictures. Viewers in Japan, the US, Australia, Canada and South Korea are already embracing the new TV technology, with a selection of primetime programmes being broadcast in the new format, which includes 5.1 digital surround sound.\\n\\nBut TV viewers in Europe will have to wait to enjoy the eye-blasting high-definition images.\\n\\nMany high-end European TV programmes, such as the recent Athens Olympics, are already being produced in high-definition. But they still reach your screen in the old 625 lines. The prospects for getting sharper images soon do not seem very encouraging. According to consultants Strategy Analytics, only 12% of homes in Europe will have TVs capable of showing programmes in high-definition by 2008. But the HDTV hype spilling out of the US and Japan has spurred European broadcasters and consumer electronic companies to push for change. Big sports and entertainment events are set to help trigger the general public\\'s attention. The 2006 World Cup in Germany will be broadcast in high-definition.\\n\\nIn the UK, satellite broadcaster BSkyB is planning HDTV services in 2006. There is already a HDTV service in Europe called Euro1080. Other European broadcasters, especially in France and Germany, also aiming to launch similar services.\\n\\nIn Britain, digital satellite and cable are largely seen as the natural home for HDTV, at least while a decision is taken regarding terrestrial broadcast options. The communications watchdog Ofcom could hand over some terrestrial frequencies freed up when the UK switches off its analogue TV signal. For now, broadcasters like the BBC are working on their own HDTV plans, although with no launch date in sight. \"The BBC will start broadcasting in HDTV when the time is right, and it would not be just a showcase, but a whole set of programming,\" says Andy Quested, from the BBC\\'s high-definition support group. \"We have made the commitment to produce all our output in high-definition by 2010, which would put us on the leading edge.\" One of the options under consideration is to offer high-definition pictures on the web. The BBC has already dipped its toe into this, including some HDTV content in recent trials of its interactive media player - a video player for PCs. It is planning to offer special releases of selected flagship programmes online in the near future. According to Mr Quested, this could help put Europe back into the running in the race to switch to HDTV. This is backed by recent research which suggests that the number of Europeans with broadband has exploded over the past 12 months, with the web eating into TV viewing habits.\\n',\n",

Quirky comedy Sideways was named best screenplay and best comedy. Ray star Jamie Foxx was best actor in a musical/comedy while Briton Clive Owen and Natalie Portman won prizes for best supporting roles in Closer.\\n\\nThe Aviator, in which DiCaprio plays millionaire Howard Hughes, edged ahead of its rivals at the Beverly Hills ceremony by winning the best original score prize. This give it a total of three awards while Million Dollar Baby, Sideways and Closer took two Golden Globes each. Accepting his best dramatic actor prize, DiCaprio described director Martin Scorsese as \"one of the greatest contributors to the world of cinema of all time\".\\n\\nAnnette Bening won best actress in a musical/comedy for Being Julia while Spanish movie The Sea Inside was named best foreign language film. Swank, who previously won the Golden Globe and Oscar for Boys Don\\'t Cry, paid tribute to Million Dollar Baby director and co-star Clint Eastwood. \"You guided us so brilliantly, while you also, in my humble opinion, gave the performance of your career,\" she said. Foxx was nominated for three awards but was beaten to the best supporting actor title by Owen and the best actor in a TV movie prize by Geoffrey Rush in The Life and Death of Peter Sellers.\\n\\nA BBC co-production, The Life and Death of Peter Sellers was also named best TV movie. Mick Jagger and Dave Stewart won the best original song award for Old Habits Die Hard from movie re-make Alfie, while Ian McShane was named best actor in a TV drama for his lead role in Deadwood.\\n\\nOther UK hopes Kate Winslet and Imelda Staunton went home empty-handed despite lead actress nominations for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Vera Drake respectively. Winning a Golden Globe is said to improve a film or performer\\'s chance of subsequently winning an Academy Award. Unlike the Oscars, the Golden Globes split awards by genre - one prize for dramas and the other for musicals and comedies. The Globes also honour the best in television, with suburban series Desperate Housewives named best TV comedy show. Actress Teri Hatcher beat fellow Desperate Housewives stars Marcia Cross and Felicity Huffman to the best comedy actress prize.\\n\\nHatcher thanked the show\\'s cast, crew and \"a network who gave me a second chance at a career when I couldn\\'t have been a bigger \\'has been\\'\". Cosmetic surgery series Nip/Tuck beat The Sopranos and Deadwood to the best television drama title. Arrested Development star Jason Bateman was named best TV actor in a musical or comedy series. The Golden Globes are awarded by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, comprising film reporters based in Los Angeles and working for overseas outlets. Robin Williams, a five-time Globe winner for such films as The Fisher King and Good Morning, Vietnam, received the Cecil B DeMille award for career achievement. He dedicated his prize to Superman actor Christopher Reeve, who died last year.\\n',\n",

The next five days will be spent counting the voting forms and preparing the winners\\' envelopes. Best actor nominee Leonardo DiCaprio is to present a statuette for the first time at the LA ceremony on Sunday.\\n\\nThe 30-year-old actor, who is nominated for playing Howard Hughes in The Aviator, will join other hopefuls such as co-star Cate Blanchett, Natalie Portman and Kate Winslet as Oscar presenters. The only people who will know the Oscar winners before they are revealed at the ceremony will be the auditors who are in charge of looking after the ballot count.\\n\\nAfter collating the results, they are responsible for sealing the results in the famous golden envelopes which will be revealed by a host of celebrity presenters at the ceremony. Former Academy Award winners Gwyneth Paltrow, Dustin Hoffman and Halle Berry will also present prizes. The event at the Kodak Theatre will be attended by 3,300 people, including some of the best-known names in film, and organisers say they expect it will be watched on television by one billion people around the world. One current concern is the torrential rain which has lashed Los Angeles for the past week, flooding suburbs and causing mudslides. It is hoped the forecast for Sunday, for cool weather but no rain, will prove accurate. \"The last time it rained on Oscars night was in the mid-to-late 1980s,\" said Oscars communications director John Pavlik. \"We have had rain up until the day before the show many times, but for some reason the Oscar gods always shine on Sunday and we hope they will do so again this year,\" he added.\\n',\n",

The actor repeatedly refused, throwing the book at her and saying: \"For the last time, I won\\'t glorify the mafia\". But Brando, who died last July at the age of 80, eventually took the role of Don Corleone, winning him an Oscar in 1973 which he notoriously refused. The actor sent a young woman dressed in Native American costume to refuse the award on his behalf and to draw attention to the plight of Native Americans.\\n\\nSchulberg told the magazine that Brando\\'s assistant realised the film star had warmed to the idea of The Godfather role when he sported a drawn-on pencil moustache and asked: \"How do I look?\" His assistant, Alice Marchak, said that he looked like George Raft, an actor famed for playing gangsters on the silver screen. Every time she went to see Brando from then on, she added, he was wearing a different gangster-style moustache. Brando was asked to screen test for the role in The Godfather, as studio executives were said to be reluctant for the actor to play the part following problems on the set of Brando\\'s previous film Mutiny on the Bounty . In fact Brando\\'s Academy Award triumph revived his career. The actor was nominated for an Oscar the following year for his role in Bernardo Bertolucci\\'s Last Tango in Paris. Before his death, Brando granted gaming company Electronic Arts the rights to use his voice and image in a video game based on the Godfather film and book and recorded voice-overs which closely resembled his role as Don Corleone. Brando\\'s co-stars from The Godfather, James Caan and Robert Duvall, will also reprise their roles for the video game, it was confirmed on Wednesday.\\n',\n",

The South Yorkshire company, led by new chief executive Gerry Spindler, said it hoped to return to profit in 2006. In early trade on Thursday, its shares were down 10% at 119 pence. UK Coal said it was making \"significant progress\" in shaking up the business. It had introduced new wage structures, a new daily maintenance regime for machinery at its mines and methods to continue mining in adverse conditions. The company said these actions should \"significantly uplift earnings\". It expected 2005 to be a \"transitional year\" and to return to profitability in 2006.\\n\\nThe recent rise in coal prices has failed to benefit the company as most of its output had already been sold, it said. Total production costs were Â£1.30 per gigajoule, UK Coal said, but the average selling price was just Â£1.18 per gigajoule. \"We have a long journey ahead to fix these issues. We continue to make progress and great strides have already been made,\" said Mr Spindler. UK Coal operates 15 deep and surface mines across Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Yorkshire, the West Midlands, Northumberland and Durham.\\n',\n",
       " 'Tories plan migrant health checks\\n\\nNon-European Union citizens wanting to work in the UK will have to undergo tests for Tuberculosis and HIV, under plans unveiled by the Conservatives.\\n\\nA positive test for TB would mean visa applications being turned down, while HIV would be dealt with case by case. Leader Michael Howard said the checks on new arrivals would help protect public health and the NHS. Labour said many tests were already done. The Lib Dems warned both parties against \"pandering to prejudice\".\\n\\nThe proposals, which would be brought in if the Conservatives won the General Election, would not apply to people coming to the UK for less than six months unless they intended to work in health or childcare or teaching. Mr Howard said the plans were based on policies already in action in Canada, New Zealand and Australia. \"It\\'s very important that we should safeguard the good standards of public health that Britain enjoys,\" he told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme. Government figures suggest TB in England has increased by 25% over the past 10 years. \"Nearly two thirds of people with TB are born abroad,\" said Mr Howard.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think a responsible government can stand aside and do nothing in the face of this problem.\" But Mr Howard said the plans would not affect asylum applicants\\' claims. The proposals include:\\n\\n- People coming to the UK from outside the EU for between six and 12 months from a \"high incidence TB country\" will have to undergo a chest X-ray. \\n - People coming to settle in the UK permanently from outside the EU will have to \"demonstrate they have an acceptable standard of health\". \\n - They will also have to show they are unlikely to be a danger to public health and are unlikely to \"impose significant costs or demands\" on the NHS. \\n - The tests will include a health check, chest X-rays for TB (except for children and pregnant women) and tests for hepatitis and HIV for over 16-year-olds. Only the discovery of TB will mean people will be automatically denied a visa, other conditions will be dealt with on a \"case by case basis\".\\n\\nThere is already some screening in place. Last year 185,000 people were tested for TB at Heathrow and Gatwick airports, only about 200 were found to be infected. And Dr John Moore-Gillon, of the British Lung Foundation, said: \"TB is not simply imported, we are seeing a rise in many sections of the UK-born population as well.\" The government says the Tories are \"a bit late\" to the issue. Immigration minister Des Browne quoted its five-year plan for immigration and asylum, as saying: \"We are implementing our existing powers by targeted health screening for TB in high-risk areas at the entry clearance stage. \"Those who are diagnosed would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the UK.\" Meanwhile Mark Oaten, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said: \"This is another worrying step in the war of words over asylum and immigration between Labour and the Conservatives. \"Michael Howard knows perfectly well what bigger game he is playing, and history proves it is a very dangerous one.\" Lisa Power, head of policy at Aids charity the Terrence Higgins Trust said the policy was prejudice-based rather than evidence-based. \"In fact, it would be more likely to drive people with health conditions to falsify tests while others gain entry by simple dint of their EU status,\" she said.\\n',\n",
       " 'Straw attacked on China arms\\n\\nMoves to lift the European Union\\'s ban on arms exports to China have been condemned by human rights groups and the Conservatives.\\n\\nThe 15 year embargo was imposed in the aftermath of China\\'s crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989. UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who will hold talks in Beijing on Thursday, said an EU arms code was more effective than the current ban. But Human Rights Watch says the EU is putting commerce above abuse concerns.\\n\\nIn December, the EU pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet. Germany and France have repeatedly called for the embargo to be lifted. Britain has been more cautious but Mr Straw last week said he also wanted it to end, despite US objections.\\n\\nHe expects it to be lifted over the next six months, a prediction which has alarmed critics. Brad Adams, from Human Rights Watch, said: \"This is a huge political signal from Europe that they are willing to forget about Tiananmen Square. \"There are still thousands of people who are unaccounted for.\"\\n\\nMr Straw said it was wrong to put China under the same embargo as countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma. The scope of the embargo was very narrow and did not have any force of law behind it, he told BBC Radio 4\\'s World At One. In the UK, more export licences were refused under the existing European Union arms code than under the embargo, he said. And only two of the licences denied under the embargo would have been granted under the code. \"The code of conduct is much more effective, it\\'s a more powerful tool of and we intend to strengthen it as a pre-condition of lifting the embargo with China,\" he said.\\n\\nMr Straw denied the decision would suggest to China that Tiananmen Square had been forgotten. The level of human rights was a key criteria under the EU arms exports code, he said. Human rights groups say the code of conduct is not legally binding - but Mr Straw said it would be given legal force by the laws of many EU countries. Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said the move would be \"profoundly wrong\". The decision could undermine Nato as it severely damaged relations with the US, which is opposed to ending the ban.\\n\\nMr Ancram argued: \"What the British Government is doing is giving in to French and German pressure, especially the French, who see vast contracts available to them if the embargo is lifted... \"It gives the wrong signals to China, who are simply not prepared to accept that what happened at Tiananmen Square was wrong.\" Mr Straw\\'s China trip is part of regular high-level meetings with Beijing ministers. He will meet Chinese counterpart Minister Li Zhaoxing to discuss developing relations between their two countries, Hong Kong and China\\'s part in the talks on North Korea.\\n',\n",

Although hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence, exercising hounds, chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal. One anti-hunt protester was taken to hospital after a violent clash in Kent.\\n\\nThe man suffered facial injuries after an incident involving a group of men at the end of the East Kent Hunt, near Ashford. In Wiltshire, police arrested four men under the new law suspected of hunting with dogs. The group, from South Wales and Ireland, have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws.\\n\\nIt is believed more than 270 hunts went out on Saturday, just one day after the ban came in.\\n\\nThey were greeted by big crowds in many areas of the country, with actor Jeremy Irons and former minister Kate Hoey among the supporters. Anti-hunt groups - such as the League Against Cruel Sports - deployed 100 monitors at hunts to check for illegal activity.\\n\\nMike Hobday, from the league, said video evidence of the law being broken was to be passed onto police. \"Our evidence suggests that most hunts did operate within the law, many meeting and promptly going home and others peacefully exercising their hounds or drag hunting. \"However, we have received reports of what we believe is clearly illegal activity by a number of hunts across Britain.\" BBC correspondent Simon Hall at Postbridge on Dartmoor in the West Country said 2,000 people had turned out to welcome the hunt.\\n\\nAnd the BBC\\'s Sarah Mukherjee, with the Beaufort Hunt in Badminton, Gloucestershire said several hundred people had gathered on foot to see the hunt, with 150 on horseback. Tom Heap, BBC rural affairs correspondent, said it appeared that hunstman had, for now, been sticking to the new rules. And while there was big turnout in support of the hunts on Saturday, he said it remains to be seen if the level of backing can be maintained.\\n\\nBefore riding out with the hunt, former minister Kate Hoey told crowds: \"We will prevail and this law will have to be overturned.\" Judith Moritz, in Melton Mowbray, said anti-hunt activists were out to monitor the four hunts operating in that part of Leicestershire, but were outnumbered by large crowds of followers. The Countryside Alliance said the meets would show the new law was \"impossibly difficult to determine\" and open to different interpretations.\\n\\nChief executive Simon Hart said: \"There has been hunting in England for 700 years. This [ban] may take two or three years, perhaps two or three months, to unpick. \"It will be nothing more than a temporary break in normal service, as broadcasters say.\" Conservative family spokeswoman Theresa May said if the party was in government again it would make sure the law was repealed. Suffolk Chief Constable Alastair McWhirter, the Association of Chief Police Officers\\' spokesman on rural policing, told the BBC the law would be enforced, although the police would not break up hunts. The Attorney General Lord Goldsmith has so far not issued any instructions to police on how they should deal with any hunters who do violate the law. He said he would consult the director of public prosecutions and the police \"in the near future\" to decide what measures to take on hunting prosecutions.\\n',\n",

Van Gogh was shot and stabbed to death in Amsterdam six weeks ago. A Dutch-Moroccan man suspected of radical Islamist links has been charged. The killing, and Fortuyn's death in 2002, convulsed the Netherlands. Many Dutch people have questioned their country's self-image as a peaceful, tolerant nation in the wake of the murders, which triggered heated debate about immigration.\\n\\nAn animal rights activist was sentenced to 18 years in prison last year for killing Fortuyn. Earlier this year, Van Gogh made a film accusing Islam of promoting violence against women. It caused outrage among Muslims and death threats were made against him. The film 06/05 will become available on the internet on Wednesday and go on general release in Dutch cinemas in January. Van Gogh's movie mixes real images of the day of Fortuyn's murder with a fictional plot about Dutch intelligence services conspiring to silence the politician. The story unfolds through the eyes of a freelance photographer who unwittingly takes pictures revealing the involvement of Dutch authorities in Fortuyn's murder.

Dirty War - screened uncut on BBC One last September - depicts a dirty bomb attack on the City of London. It is also being screened uncut on US cable channel HBO on 24 January.

Ms Atlas said PBS could put itself financially at risk if it showed the uncut version of Dirty War, and it could also deter many of its 170 individual stations from airing \"an important film\". \"You want to pick your battles,\" she said. She added that PBS, which is a private, non-profit media enterprise owned and operated by the nation\\'s 349 public television stations, is bolder about screening non-fiction or historical programming.

The books tell of a battle against the church and a fight to overthrow God. \"They have expressed worry about the possibility of perceived anti-religiosity,\" Weitz told a His Dark Materials fans\\' website. Pullman\\'s trilogy has been attacked by some Christian teachers and by the Catholic press as blasphemy. Weitz, who admitted he would not be many people\\'s first choice to direct the films, said he regarded the film adaptation as \"the most important work of my life\".\\n\\n\"In part because it is one of the few books to have changed my life,\" he told bridgetothestars.net. The award-winning trilogy - Northern Lights, The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass - tell the story of Oxford school child Lyra Belacqua. She is drawn into an epic struggle against the Church, which has been carrying out experiments on children in an attempt to remove original sin.\\n\\nAs the books progress the struggle turns into a battle to overthrow the Authority, a figure who is God-like in the books. Weitz, who directed American Pie and About A Boy, said New Line feared that any anti-religiosity in the film would make the project \"unviable financially\". He said: \"All my best efforts will be directed towards keeping the film as liberating and iconoclastic an experience as I can. \"But there may be some modification of terms.\"\\n\\nWeitz said he had visited Pullman, who had told him that the Authority could \"represent any arbitrary establishment that curtails the freedom of the individual, whether it be religious, political, totalitarian, fundamentalist, communist, what have you\". He added: \"I have no desire to change the nature or intentions of the villains of the piece, but they may appear in more subtle guises.\" There are a number of Christian websites which attack the trilogy for their depiction of the church and of God, but Pullman has denied his books are anti-religious. His agent told the Times newspaper that Pullman was happy with the adaptation so far. \"Of course New Line want to make money, but Mr Weitz is a wonderful director and Philip is very supportive. \"You have to recognise that it is a challenge in the climate of Bush\\'s America,\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Hollywood to sue net film pirates\\n\\nThe US movie industry has launched legal action to sue people who facilitate illegal film downloading.\\n\\nThe Motion Picture Association of America wants to stop people using the program BitTorrent to swap movies. The industry is targeting people who run websites which provide information and internet links to movies which have been copied or filmed in cinemas. More than 100 server operators have been targeted in the actions launched in the US and UK, the MPAA added. The suits were filed against users of the file-sharing programs BitTorrent, eDonkey and DirectConnect in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Finland and the Netherlands, the MPAA said.\\n\\nBitTorrent users can download movies by following a link to files which are found on websites called trackers. Unlike most peer-to-peer programs BitTorrent works by sharing a file, which could be anything from a legitimate digital photo to a copied movie, among multiple users at the same time. The movie industry hopes that suing the people who run the trackers will cut BitTorrent users off from illegal movies at source. Last month major film studios started legal action against 200 individuals who were swapping films online. The growth in broadband has made it quicker for people to download movies and the industry fears that if it does not take action now, it could suffer the same downturn as the music industry.\\n',\n",
       " \"Bond game fails to shake or stir\\n\\nFor gaming fans, the word GoldenEye evokes excited memories not only of the James Bond revival flick of 1995, but also the classic shoot-em-up that accompanied it and left N64 owners glued to their consoles for many an hour.\\n\\nAdopting that hallowed title somewhat backfires on this new game, for it fails to deliver on the promise of its name and struggles to generate the original's massive sense of fun. This however is not a sequel, nor does it relate to the GoldenEye film. You are the eponymous renegade spy, an agent who deserts to the Bond world's extensive ranks of criminal masterminds, after being deemed too brutal for MI6. Your new commander-in-chief is the portly Auric Goldfinger, last seen in 1964, but happily running around bent on world domination. With a determination to justify its name which is even less convincing than that of Tina Turner's similarly-titled theme song, the game literally gives the player a golden eye following an injury, which enables a degree of X-ray vision.\\n\\nRogue Agent signals its intentions by featuring James Bond initially and proceeding to kill him off within moments, squashed by a plummeting helicopter. The notion is of course to add a novel dark edge to a 007 game, but the premise simply does not get the juices flowing like it needs to.\\n\\nRecent Bond games like Nightfire and Everything Or Nothing were very competent and did a fine job of capturing the sense of flair, invention and glamour of the film franchise. This title lacks that aura, and when the Bond magic shines through, it feels like a lucky accident. The central problem is that the gameplay just is not good enough. Quite aside from the bizarre inability to jump, the even more bizarre glaring graphical bugs and dubious enemy AI, the levels simply are not put together with much style or imagination. Admittedly the competition has been tough, even in recent weeks, with the likes of Halo 2 and Half Life 2 triumphing in virtually every department. What the game is good at is enveloping you in noisy, dynamic scenes of violent chaos. As is the trend of late, you are made to feel like you are in the midst of a really messy and fraught encounter. Sadly that sense of action is outweighed by the difficulty of navigating and battling within the chaos, meaning that frustration is often the outcome. And irregular save points mean you have to backtrack each time you are killed. A minute red dot passes for a crosshair, although the collision-detection is so suspect that the difficulties of aiming weapons are compensated for. Shooting enemies from a distance can be tricky, and you will not always know you have picked them off, since dead enemies vanish literally before they have fully hit the floor, and they do so in some woefully uninspiring death animations. It is perhaps indicative of a lack of confidence that the game maker's allow you several different weapons almost immediately and throw you quickly into raging firefights - no time is risked with a measured build-up.\\n\\nBy far the most satisfying element of the game is seeing old favourites like Dr No, Goldfinger, hat-fiend Oddjob and crazed Russian sex beast Xenia Onatopp resurrected after all these years, and with their faces rendered in an impressively recognisable fashion.\\n\\nThere is a real thrill from doing battle with these legendary villains, and it is a testament to the power of the Bond universe that they can cut such a dash. But the in-game niggles, combined with a story and presentation that just do not feel sufficiently well thought-through, will make this a disappointment for most. Diehard fans of Bond will probably find enough here to make it a worthwhile purchase and try to ignore the failings. The game is weak, not completely unplayable. Then again, 007 fanatics may also take umbrage at the cavalier blending of characters from different eras. Given James Bond's healthy pedigree in past games, there is every reason to hope that this is just a blip, a commendable idea that just has not worked, that will be rectified when the character inevitably makes his return.\\n\\nGoldenEye: Rogue Agent is out now\\n\",\n",
       " 'Berlin cheers for anti-Nazi film\\n\\nA German movie about an anti-Nazi resistance heroine has drawn loud applause at Berlin Film Festival.\\n\\nSophie Scholl - The Final Days portrays the final days of the member of the White Rose movement. Scholl, 21, was arrested and beheaded with her brother, Hans, in 1943 for distributing leaflets condemning the \"abhorrent tyranny\" of Adolf Hitler. Director Marc Rothemund said: \"I have a feeling of responsibility to keep the legacy of the Scholls going.\" \"We must somehow keep their ideas alive,\" he added.\\n\\nThe film drew on transcripts of Gestapo interrogations and Scholl\\'s trial preserved in the archive of communist East Germany\\'s secret police. Their discovery was the inspiration behind the film for Rothemund, who worked closely with surviving relatives, including one of Scholl\\'s sisters, to ensure historical accuracy on the film. Scholl and other members of the White Rose resistance group first started distributing anti-Nazi leaflets in the summer of 1942. They were arrested as they dropped leaflets at Munich University calling for a \"day of reckoning\" with Adolf Hitler\\'s regime. The film focuses on the six days from Scholl\\'s arrest to the intense trial which saw Scholl initially deny the charges and ended with a defiant appearance. It is one of three German films vying for a top prize at the Festival.\\n\\nA South African film version of Bizet\\'s tragic opera Carmen shot in Cape Town in the Xhosa language has also premiered at the Berlin Festival. The film is entitled U-Carmen eKhayelitsha or Carmen in Khayelitsha after the township in which the story is set. It is performed by a 40-strong music and theatre troupe in their debut film performance. The film is the first South African feature in 25 years and only the second to be nominated for a Golden Bear Award.\\n',\n",

Last week\\'s chart-topper, the Robert de Niro thriller Hide and Seek, fell to number four. Other new entries included The Wedding Date, a comedy starring Will and Grace\\'s Debra Messing, at number two.\\n\\nThe road-trip comedy Are We There Yet? and multiple Oscar nominee Million Dollar Baby completed the top five. Other Oscar contenders, including The Aviator and Sideways, continued to perform strongly at the box office. The Aviator has taken $75m (Â£40m) so far, while Sideways has taken $46.8m (Â£24.8m) in a more limited release.\\n\\nBoogeyman, which cost just $7m (Â£3.5m) to make, performed well even though it was not screened to critics before release - normally a sign that a film will get bad reviews or perform poorly at the box office. \"I certainly believe it\\'s a genre where people are going to be more moved by the marketing materials for the movie than by what the critics say,\" said Rory Bruer, head of distribution for Sony Pictures, which released the film in the US. Overall the weekend box office was strong despite the fact that it was American football\\'s Super Bowl weekend - a time when cinema admissions generally fall. This year, the top 12 films grossed around $91m (Â£48.3m), compared to 2004\\'s Super Bowl weekend when the total box office was $73.4m (Â£38.9m).\\n',\n",
       " 'Ryanair in $4bn Boeing plane deal\\n\\nBudget airline Ryanair has placed an order for 70 Boeing 737-800 planes, in a deal valued at $4bn (Â£2.1bn) which should lead to 2,500 new Ryanair jobs.\\n\\nIt also has an option for a further 70 aircraft, a move which brings the Ryanair/Boeing order book up to 225 firm orders and options on 193 more. Ryanair said the new planes would help it to cut operating costs further. The carrier reported a drop in quarterly profit earlier this year after it was hit by higher fuel costs. However, when it reported the results, the airline was upbeat about prospects for 2005, despite tough competition in the budget airline market.\\n\\nRyanair chairman David Bonderman said that the 737-800 had \"significantly reduced our unit operating costs and allowed us to reduce air fares each year for the last five years\".\\n\\n\"With this new order and new pricing in place, Ryanair expects that unit operating costs (excluding fuel) will continue to fall each year for the next five years,\" he added. At the end of this year, Ryanair will have taken delivery of about 100 new planes, while the 70 new orders are due for delivery between 2008 and 2012. The airline said that when all these planes have been delivered, it will be able to carry more than 70 million passengers a year, making it Europe\\'s largest airline. About 2,500 new jobs should be created in the next seven years, it added. The order can be seen as good news for Boeing, which in recent years has been overtaken by European plane maker Airbus as the world\\'s biggest-selling plane maker.\\n',\n",
       " 'Brown to outline presidency goals\\n\\nNext year will be \"make or break\" for development in poorer countries Gordon Brown will say as he sets out UK goals for its EU and G8 presidencies.\\n\\nThe chancellor is due to outline a series of key targets the government will be judged on in 2005. They will include doubling aid from donor countries and eliminating debt owed by the poorest nations. Mr Brown also wants other G8 nations to match his target for overseas aid - spending 0.7% of national income.\\n\\nHe also wants the richer countries to do more to help the development of vaccines for Aids and malaria. The chancellor is travelling to America next week as part of his persuasion drive over the issue. He told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme: \"We need more resources allied to progress on trade and progress on debt relief if we are going to make an impact on the problems of ill health, of illiteracy, of poverty, particularly in Africa but right through the developing countries.\"\\n\\nHis proposals were effectively a new \"Marshall Plan\" for the world, including an international finance facility, which would issue bonds in an attempt to double global aid cash to $100bn a year. Agreement in the Doha development talks could also give developing nations the trading ability they needed, he argued. The European Union\\'s Common Agricultural Policy had caused aggravated trade problems, he said, but there was now an agreement to end export subsidies.\\n\\nMr Brown said much had been achieved on issues such as debt relief in the last seven years. But with 30,000 children were dying unnecessarily every day more was needed, including 100% debt relief multilaterally. \"That is why next year is a test,\" he said. \"If after five years of making promises the world is not prepared to honour them, then people will be justified in saying they promised but they did not produce results.\" The Catholic aid agency Cafod will host Mr Brown\\'s speech on Wednesday.\\n\\nCafod wants Britain to use its influence to pressure countries like the US to make firm commitments to tackle global poverty. Mr Brown said America too needed to take more action but defended President George Bush for guaranteeing resources to countries which introduced reforms to tackle corruption. Oxfam\\'s Paying the Price report this week said 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 and aid budgets are half their 1960 levels. The charity\\'s director, Barbara Stocking, said: \"2005 offers the chance for an historic breakthrough, but unless world leaders act now the year will end in shameful failure.\" The report said the G8 of top industrialised nations had agreed in 1970 to spend 0.7% of their incomes on aid.\\n\\nBut 34 years later none of the organisations members had reached this target and many had not yet set a timetable. Mr Blair, who has described Africa as a \"scar\" on the world\\'s conscience, has already said tackling world poverty would be one his G8 priorities along with climate change and the Aids epidemic. But Band Aid founder Bob Geldof in July said he was sick of hearing \"guff\" about scars on the world. It was pathetic that Britain was the 4th richest country in the world but only the 11th most generous aid donor, he added. Conservative shadow international development secretary Alan Duncan accused Mr Brown of missing his target on providing anti-retroviral drug treatment to three million Africans by 2005. Instead, only 500,000 people would benefit, he said. \"There\\'s no point in him demanding praise and adulation for setting a whole new raft of targets when he has so woefully failed to meet the ones he already has,\" added Mr Duncan.\\n',\n",

Meanwhile Labour backbencher Stephen Pound labelled casino-related regeneration schemes \"a pile of pants\". The MP for Ealing North claimed the legislation would encourage a mafia-like culture of vice and corruption, in an interview on BBC Radio 4. \"You look at some of the people who are involved...they aren\\'t in there to regenerate Blackpool. They are in it to fill their boots,\" Mr Pound told the Today programme. \"I just really think that we have made a terrible mistake here. And over all of it hangs the shadow of the men in the chalk-stripe suits with names that rhyme with spaghetti,\" he said.\\n\\nMs Jowell complained of the \"scale of misrepresentation\" in the media over the bill in her interview with the newspaper, her first since the bill was launched. The culture secretary said a four year consultation period had produced a consensus on the need to \"protect children and the vulnerable\" in a swiftly changing sector. Ms Jowell insisted: \"We have a good track record for extracting planning gain in this country, for instance in social housing.\" And continued: \"We can be proud to have one of the lowest rates of problem gambling in the world. I intend to keep it that way.\" Ms Jowell will set out her position when the Bill is debated in the Commons on Monday. In prime minister\\'s questions last week Tony Blair assured Parliament that 90% of the bill was about tightening up the regulation of the gambling industry.\\n',\n",
       " 'Retirement age could be scrapped\\n\\nThe \"myth that ageing is a barrier\" to contributing to society needs to be \"exploded\", the work and pensions minister has said.\\n\\nThis was why the government was considering scrapping the retirement age entirely, Alan Johnson said. It was also committed to \"stamping out\" age discrimination and would outlaw it, he told a conference on ageing. All three parties have been wooing older voters with both the Tories and Lib Dems pledging higher pensions.\\n\\nMr Johnson told Age Concern\\'s Age Agenda in London the government was \"seriously considering\" introducing pensions based on residency rather than national insurance contributions. This idea has been adopted by the Lib Dems as policy, while the Tories have pledged to boost pensions by restoring the link between earnings and pensions. Mr Johnson\\'s speech comes after he last week unveiled plans to find a consensus on how to reform the country\\'s pension system. This would be based on a series of principles including tackling pensioner poverty and fairer pensions for women, he said. Speaking at the London conference he said: \"Generalised stereotypes of people past state pension age as dependant, incapable and vulnerable are a particularly pernicious form of age discrimination\".\\n\\nThe government wanted to tackle this by moving to a culture where retirement ages were \"increasingly consigned to the past\". \"We\\'re sweeping them away entirely for people under 65, and we\\'re giving those above that age a right to request to work past 65 which their employers will have to engage with seriously. \"And the review in 2011, which will look at whether it is time to sweep retirement ages away entirely, is to be tied to evidence ... showing that retirement ages are increasingly outmoded\". Mr Johnson said his department had a long-term aspiration of moving towards an 80% employment rate. This would involve an extra one million older people joining the work force, he said.\\n',\n",

The rest of the world should listen,\" the prime minister said in an interview with The Times newspaper, published on Friday. Mr Blair is at a summit in Brussels, where Iraq and European justice and immigration plans are on the agenda. French President Jacques Chirac reacted to his warning by saying Europe instead needed to reinforce its own unity. Mr Blair has probably been closer to President Bush than any other European leader.\\n\\nHe said some people were in \"a sort of state of denial\" about the US election result but predicted a more \"receptive mood\" would emerge soon. America needed to listen to the world too, he said. \"The fact is that President Bush is there for four years. He is there because the American people have chosen him,\" he argued. He also made clear he intended to take seriously what he perceives as his role in bringing the two continents together.\\n\\nBritain was \"uniquely placed\" to make out the common ground because of its strong alliance with the US, he suggested. He admitted he had gone to bed at 2230GMT, well before the American polls closed, thinking Mr Kerry might have won. He woke up at 0530GMT to discover Mr Bush had won but declined to say if he was pleased with the eventual result. His words about President Bush met a cool reception from Jacques Chirac. The French president told reporters: \"Europe today has more than ever the need, the necessity, to reinforce itself and its dynamism and unity. \"That is the goal of the constitution in a world that is more multi-polar than ever.\"\\n\\nMr Chirac will miss an address to the summit from Iraqi interim leader Iyad Allawi, who this week criticised nations which took a \"spectator\" role to Iraq\\'s reconstruction. Mr Chirac denied there was any snub - he is going to a memorial service for the United Arab Emirates\\' late leader and says he would be happy to meet Mr Allawi. He also signed a communiqu&#233; stressing the EU\\'s commitment to securing a stable and unified Iraq. The EU also confirmed a new $21m aid package. The communiqu&#233; congratulated President Bush on his victory and stressed the importance of good transatlantic relations. The summit is also expected to agree changes to streamline European asylum and immigration decisions. Mr Blair recently said the UK would only participate in EU-wide measures where it was in UK interests but the Tories say he is surrendering a key veto. The meeting will also assess progress on the economic reform plans agreed in Lisbon in 2000 to make Europe more competitive.\\n',\n",

The economy has grown for six quarters but growth slowed dramatically in the last quarter amid weaker global demand. Japan\\'s government remains optimistic due to strong domestic demand.\\n\\nAnalysts had been forecasting a 0.1% rise in month on month industrial output.\\n\\nAccording to figures from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), the decline was led by a fall in demand for electronic parts for mobile phones and digital televisions. Although inventories fell 0.7% month on month, they were 36% higher than a year ago. \"It\\'s a sign that the economy\\'s adjustment phase is stronger than expected,\" said Takashi Yamanaka, an economist with UFJ Bank. Japan downgraded its overall economic assessment earlier this month for the first time in a year.\\n\\nGrowth slowed to 0.3% in the quarter ending September 30, down from 6.3% in the first quarter of 2004. Experts believe the economy -which stagnated for most of the 1990s -may be entering a softer patch on the back of rising oil prices and the falling dollar. Japanese government officials played down the latest data, arguing that domestic consumer demand was still resilient. \"The outlook for November is positive so I don\\'t think one can say that conditions have worsened just because of the fall in October,\" said a METI official. Despite the rise in unemployment, jobless figures are still some way below historical highs of recent years.

Mr D\\'Souza says he is shocked at the Censor Board\\'s decision to clear the film. Our correspondent says that India\\'s TV channels have so far refused to be dragged into the controversy and have not screened the film\\'s promotional material.

       " 'Microsoft sets sights on spyware\\n\\nWindows users could soon be paying Microsoft to keep PCs free of spyware.\\n\\nFollowing the takeover of anti-spyware firm Giant, Microsoft said it would soon release a toolkit that strips machines of the irritating programs. Although initially free, Microsoft has not ruled out charging people who want to keep this toolkit up to date. Surveys show that almost every Windows PC is infested with spyware programs that do everything from bombard users with adverts to steal login data. Microsoft said that a beta version of the toolkit to clean up Windows machines should be available within 30 days.\\n\\nDesigned for PCs running Windows 2000 and XP, the utility will clean out spyware programs, constantly monitor what happens on a PC and will be regularly updated to catch the latest variants. Before now many of Microsoft\\'s other security boosting programs, such as the firewall in Windows XP, have been given away free. But Mike Nash, vice president in Microsoft\\'s security business unit, said it was still working out pricing and licensing issues. Charging for future versions has not been discounted, he said. \"We\\'ll come up with a plan and roll that out,\" he said. The plan could turn out to be a lucrative one for Microsoft. A recent survey by Earthlink and Webroot found that 90% of PCs are infested with the surreptitious software and that, on average, each one is harbouring 28 separate spyware programs. Currently users wanting protection from spyware have turned to free programs such as Spybot and Ad-Aware.

       " 'Humanoid robot learns how to run\\n\\nCar-maker Honda\\'s humanoid robot Asimo has just got faster and smarter.\\n\\nThe Japanese firm is a leader in developing two-legged robots and the new, improved Asimo (Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility) can now run, find his way around obstacles as well as interact with people. Eventually Asimo could find gainful employment in homes and offices. \"The aim is to develop a robot that can help people in their daily lives,\" said a Honda spokesman.\\n\\nTo get the robot running for the first time was not an easy process as it involved Asimo making an accurate leap and absorbing the impact of landing without slipping or spinning. The \"run\" he is now capable of is perhaps not quite up to Olympic star Kelly Holmes\\' standard. At 3km/h, it is closer to a leisurely jog. Its makers claim that it is almost four times as fast as Sony\\'s Qrio, which became the first robot to run last year. The criteria for running robots is defined by engineers as having both feet off the ground between strides. Asimo has improved in other ways too, increasing his walking speed, from 1.6km/h to 2.5km, growing 10cm to 130cm and putting on 2kg in weight. While he may not quite be ready for yoga, he does have more freedom of movement, being able to twist his hips and bend his wrists, thumbs and neck.\\n\\nAsimo has already made his mark on the international robot scene and in November was inducted into the Robot Hall of Fame. He has wowed audiences around the world with his ability to walk upstairs, recognise faces and come when beckoned. In August 2003 he even attended a state dinner in the Czech Republic, travelling with the Japanese prime minister as a goodwill envoy. He is one of a handful of robots used by tech firms to trumpet their technological advances. Technology developed for Asimo could be used in the automobile industry as electronics increasingly take over from mechanics in car design. For the moment Asimo\\'s biggest role is an entertainer and the audience gathered to see his first public run greeted his slightly comical gait with amusement, according to reports. Robots can fulfil serious functions in society and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe predicts that the worldwide market for industrial robots will swell from 81,000 units in 2003 to 106,000 in 2007.\\n',\n",

Miyazaki won an Oscar earlier this year for Spirited Away, Japan\\'s first Academy Award for nearly 50 years. Howl\\'s Moving Castle is based on a children\\'s fantasy novel by UK author Diana Wynne Jones. It tells the story of an 18-year-old woman who ages dramatically after falling under a witch\\'s spell. She heads to a moving castle kept by Howl, a wizard, and searches for a way to become normal again. A spokesman for distributor Toho said the film \"has received strong interest from domestic audiences and foreign media and viewers alike\". \"We have a good feeling about this film. We saw very good viewer response,\" he added. The film\\'s worldwide release will start in South Korea on 24 December, and France on 12 January.\\n',\n",

Hollywood\\'s honorary mayor, Johnny Grant, said: \"I do hereby proclaim this Godzilla Day in Hollywood.\\n\\n\"He\\'s loose, he\\'s wild, and I\\'m getting the hell out of here,\" he added. The premiere of Godzilla: Final Wars at Grauman\\'s Chinese Theatre followed the ceremony on Hollywood Boulevard. The monster was joined by co-stars including Japanese pop star and actor Masahiro Matsuoka. Director Ryuhei Kitamura said it may not be Godzilla\\'s final outing, as it has been billed. \"That\\'s what the producers say. But the producer\\'s a liar,\" he said. \"[Godzilla\\'s] been working for the last 50 years. So, I think Godzilla just deserves a vacation.\" And producer Shogo Tomiyama added: \"So long as Godzilla can fascinate people, I believe he will be resurrected by new generations of filmmakers in the future.\" Godzilla first appeared in 1954 as a prehistoric lizard woken by atomic bomb tests.\\n',\n",

Its star Hilary Swank is favourite to win best actress while Jamie Foxx is tipped to win best actor for Ray. Million Dollar Baby has seven nominations while The Aviator has 11. The Aviator has scored a best director nomination for Martin Scorsese, who has never won an Oscar, while stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett are both nominated for acting Oscars.\\n\\n\"If you look at the Oscars race, The Aviator should be ahead,\" said awards pundit Tom O\\'Neil. \"It is the most nominated film, and the most nominated movie has won best picture 18 times out of the last 20 years. \"But the reality is Million Dollar Baby is the dark horse. People feel emotionally about it and Clint is a beloved Hollywood chum of the Academy voters,\" he said. Anne Thompson of the Hollywood Reporter said that Million Dollar Baby was \"heart-wrenching\". \"It\\'s very emotional, it even makes grown men cry,\" she said. \"The Aviator is a gorgeous movie, but it\\'s colder.\"\\n\\nIn the acting categories, Foxx is regarded as almost unbeatable for his performance as Ray Charles in Ray. \"The performance is based on a real person who was a showbusiness hero with a handicap, who recently died,\" O\\'Neil said. \"He has unstoppable momentum among the voters.\" Hilary Swank is the favourite to win best actress for the second time in six years. She previously won in 1999 for her performance in Boys Don\\'t Cry. In the supporting categories, Cate Blanchett is tipped to win for her performance as Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator, while Morgan Freeman is favourite to take home his first ever Oscar, for Million Dollar Baby. The Oscars will take place at Hollywood\\'s Kodak Theatre on 27 February.\\n',\n",
       " 'Japan economy slides to recession\\n\\nThe Japanese economy has officially gone back into recession for the fourth time in a decade.\\n\\nGross domestic product fell by 0.1% in the last three months of 2004. The fall reflects weak exports and a slowdown in consumer spending, and follows similar falls in GDP in the two previous quarters. The Tokyo stock market fell after the figures were announced, but rose again on a widespread perception that the economy will recover later this year. On Wednesday, the government revised growth figures from earlier in 2004 which, when taking into account performance in the most recent period, effectively tips Japan into recession.\\n\\nA previous estimate of 0.1% growth between July and September was downgraded to a 0.3% decline. A recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth, although the Japanese government takes other factors into account when judging the status of its economy.\\n\\nFigures released by the government\\'s Cabinet Office showed that GDP, on an annualised basis, fell 0.5% in the last three months of 2004. However, politicians remain upbeat about prospects for an economic boost later in the year. \"The economy has some soft patches but if you look at the bigger picture, it is in a recovery stage,\" said Economic and Fiscal Policy Minister Heizo Takenaka. Gross domestic product measures the overall value of goods and services produced in a country. \"The economy must be assessed comprehensively and we cannot look at GDP alone,\" Mr Takenaka stressed.\\n\\nMinisters pointed to the fact that consumer spending had been depressed by one-off factors such as the unseasonably mild winter. Analysts said the figures were disappointing but argued that Japan\\'s largest companies had been recording healthy profits and capital spending was on the rise. Japan\\'s economy grew 2.6% overall last year - fuelled by a strong performance in the first few months - and is forecast to see growth of 2.1% in 2005. However, the economy\\'s fragile recovery remains dependent on an upturn in consumer spending, a fall in the value of the yen and an improvement in global economies. \"The results came in at the lower end of expectations but we shouldn\\'t be too pessimistic about the current state and the outlook for the economy,\" said Naoki Iizuka, senior economist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. Japan\\'s economy has seen stretches of moderate growth over the past decade but has periodically slipped back into recession.\\n',\n",
       " 'Bad weather hits Nestle sales\\n\\nA combination of bad weather, rising raw material costs and the sluggish European economy has hit sales at Swiss food and drink giant Nestle.\\n\\nRevenue dipped 1.4% to 86.7bn Swiss francs ($74.6bn; Â£39.1bn) in 2004 as sales of ice cream and mineral water were dampened by the wet summer. However, Nestle\\'s profits margins were helped by a strong performance in the Americas and China. Nestle is to raise its dividend by 11% after paying back some of its debt.\\n\\nNestle said that the strength of the Swiss franc against the US dollar, the disposal of businesses and challenging trading conditions in Europe all dented sales. A poor summer across the continent - in contrast to the prolonged heat wave in 2003 - \"severely affected\" demand for ice cream. Sales of bottled water also fell, although chocolate, coffee, frozen goods and petcare products performed better.\\n\\nElsewhere, Nestle said it had enjoyed an \"exceptional\" year in North America, outperforming the market in terms of sales growth. Nestle added that it had performed strongly in Africa and Asia despite the impact of high oil prices and political instability. Nestle\\'s total earnings before interest remained broadly flat over the past year, despite the company managing to boost profit margins. As well as increasing its dividend, Nestle plans to buy back shares worth 1bn Swiss francs ($861m; Â£451m). Looking forward, Nestle forecasts organic earnings growth of about 5% in 2005, although it warned that trading would remain just as competitive.\\n\\nUncertainty remains over the future of Perrier, the iconic French mineral water owned by Nestle. Perrier has been locked in a long-standing dispute with unions about productivity levels at the business, which has lead Nestle to consider selling the firm. \"The option of selling is Perrier is still on the table,\" chief executive Peter Brabeck-Letmathe confirmed on Thursday.\\n',\n",
       " 'Bid to cut court witness stress\\n\\nNew targets to reduce the stress to victims and witnesses giving evidence in courts in England and Wales have been announced by the lord chancellor.\\n\\nLord Falconer wants all crown courts and 90% of magistrates\\' courts to have facilities to keep witnesses separate from defendants within four years. More video links will also be made available so that witnesses do not have to enter courtrooms. It is part of a five-year plan to help build confidence in the justice system.\\n\\nMinisters say the strategy is aimed at re-balancing the court system towards victims, and increasing the number of offenders brought to justice. Launching the Department for Constitutional Affairs\\' plan, Lord Falconer said: \"One of the top priorities will be a better deal for victims. \"The needs and safety of victims will be at the heart of the way trials are managed.\\n\\n\"Courts, judges, magistrates, prosecutors, police and victim support - all working together to ensure the rights of victims are put first, without compromising the rights of the defendant.\" He went on: \"Giving evidence is a nerve-wracking experience, especially when you\\'re a victim. \"Yet with a will and with support it can be done.\" Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme it was impossible for some elderly people to go to court to give evidence. Other witnesses could be intimidated by sitting alongside defendants outside courts. \"You are never going to get rid of some element of the trauma of giving evidence,\" he said. \"But you can make people believe that the courts understand the problem, it\\'s not some kind of alien place where they go where they are not thinking about them.\"\\n\\nThe plan comes as the lord chancellor also considers allowing cameras into courts for the first time since 1925, as long as they were used for cases that did not involve witnesses. Another feature of the strategy is constitutional reform, with a government bill to set up a supreme court and a judicial appointments commission returning to the House of Lords on Tuesday. Ministers had proposed getting rid of the title of lord chancellor, but the Lords have over-ruled this. Lord Falconer said it was right for the highest court to be completely distinct from Parliament. The person in charge of the court system should not also be speaker of the House of Lords, he said, and should be the best person chosen from either House of Parliament. What they did, not what they were called, was the critical issue, he added.\\n',\n",

The call comes as the prime minister prepares to assume the presidency of the G8 of top industrialised nations. \"As rich countries get richer, they\\'re giving less and less. This scandal must stop,\" Oxfam\\'s Barbara Stocking said.\\n\\n\"The world\\'s poorest children are paying for rich countries\\' policies in aid and debt with their lives. \"2005 offers the chance for an historic breakthrough, but unless world leaders act now the year will end in shameful failure,\" the charity\\'s director added. The report said: \"For rich countries, providing aid to help to end global poverty is an obligation and a matter of justice, not an act of charity.\" It also points out that in 1970 the G8 of top industrialised nations agreed to spend 0.7% of their incomes on aid. But 34 years later none of the organisations members have reached this target and many have not yet set a timetable, the report says.\\n\\nIt argues that the price of not investing in poor countries\\' sustainable development will be felt across the world. The report said: \"Global poverty threatens our shared prosperity and security. \"Environmental crises and natural disasters, disease and drug trafficking know no national borders. Poverty heightens the likelihood of conflict and unrest. \"New threats to the peace and security of rich nations arise from poverty and gross inequalities. \"Criminal and terrorist networks are more likely to operate where state institutions are weak.\"\\n\\nBoth the prime minister and Chancellor Gordon Brown have called for urgent action to fight world poverty. Mr Blair, who has described Africa as a \"scar\" on the world\\'s conscience, has already said tackling world poverty would be one his G8 priorities along with climate change and the Aids epidemic. Mr Brown has also pledged to write off the debt owed to Britain by the world\\'s poor nations. A spokeswoman for the Department for International Development said: \"The government had made a clear commitment to reaching 0.7% of gross national income for overseas development aid by 2013. \"If Britain\\'s proposal for an International Finance Facility were adopted, the objective of 0.7% could be achieved earlier, by 2008-09. \"These additional resources will be used to increase UK bilateral aid to Africa to at least Â£1.25bn a year by 2008 and spend at least Â£1.5bn on HIV/Aids related work over the next three years.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Wales \\'must learn health lessons\\'\\n\\nThe new health minister for Wales says there are lessons to learn from England in tackling waiting lists.\\n\\nDr Brian Gibbons, on his first full day in the job after Jane Hutt was sacked, admitted \"big challenges\" but insisted the \"essentials\" were in place. But both Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats said Dr Gibbons needed to change policy. Meanwhile Ms Hutt defended her record, saying waiting times and lists were \"only 10% of the health agenda. Dr Gibbons, who was a GP in Blaengwynfi, in the Upper Afan Valley, before becoming AM for Aberavon, said NHS staff wanted a period of consolidation after \"tremendous change and reform\". One of the biggest problems which had faced Ms Hutt during her five-and-a-half years as the assembly\\'s first health minister was the length of waiting lists in Wales.\\n\\nIn November the British Medical Association said NHS staff were \"weeping with despair\" as figures showed 311,000 people were waiting for treatment in Wales, up by 2,400 on the previous month. In the same month lists in England were at their lowest for 17 years, with 856,600 people waiting for treatment. Dr Gibbons told Radio Wales: \"There is no doubt that, in managing waiting lists, England has done a lot of very very useful work, and we do need to learn from that.\"\\n\\nBut he said the NHS in Wales also needed to create a healthier population rather than respond only to ill health, and a balanced view of priorities was important. \"We do need a consistent across-the-board approach, recognising the patients\\' experience of how they use the service is going to be, at the end of the day, the main test of how the service is working.\" He said NHS staff wanted a period of consolidation after \"tremendous change and reform\". Later, Dr Gibbons praised the work of Ms Hutt, saying he \"agreed with everything she\\'s done\" to change the health service in Wales. Dr Gibbons said he accepted there was a problem, but his job now was to build on the foundations put in place by his predecessor. He also acknowledged that until the waiting list issue was sorted out, the rest of the assembly government\\'s health policy would be overshadowed.\\n\\nOpposition members and some Labour MPs had long called for Ms Hutt\\'s removal after sustained criticism over extended hospital waiting times. First Minister Rhodri Morgan told BBC Wales he had agreed with Ms Hutt in 2003 that she would not be health minister in the run-up to the 2007 elections. \"She\\'s been doing the job for five years and eight months and, apart from Nye Bevan himself, (architect of the NHS), I don\\'t think anybody has ever done the job for so long.\" Mr Morgan said he had only told Ms Hutt of the reshuffle on Monday morning, and said the NHS in Wales was Dr Gibbons\\' \"baby\" now. In response to Dr Gibbons\\' comments, Ieuan Wyn Jones, leader of the Plaid Cymru group in the assembly, said: \"It is apparent that this reshuffle by the first minister was just changing the deckchairs on a sinking Titanic.\" Kisrty Williams, for the Lib Dems, added: \"If the underlying policy is going to continue, then changing the minister will serve no purpose, other than to deflect flak from Labour\\'s MPs,\" she said. Meanwhile Ms Hutt said she hoped \"that the people of Wales would benefit from my investment of the past five years and eight months\" Asked about waiting lists, she said that waiting times and lists were \"only 10% of the health agenda\" and that the Welsh Assembly Government had \"turned the corner\" on the issue.\\n',\n",

But he was suspended after his reported views, including the return of the British Empire, were sent to two Scottish newspapers. UKIP spokesman Mark Croucher said those who selected Mr Houston knew nothing of his views. The episode comes at a difficult time for UKIP, soon after the high-profile departure of MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk. Mr Houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be \"made available to law-abiding members of the community\" and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade. The document reportedly said: \"We\\'re looking for the resurrection of the British Empire. \"The problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale, and that calls for a radical alliance of the English-speaking nations, which they are uniquely able to do.\" Mr Croucher said the main issue would be that Mr Houston\\'s reported views had been presented as UKIP policy, which they were not. He said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the party\\'s manifesto, but would not have been matched to Mr Houston when he was standing to become a candidate. He told BBC News: \"He appears to have said these things. We have suspended him as a member and as a candidate. \"By all accounts none of this was mentioned at his selection meeting. \"It is simply a distraction from the task in hand, the EU constitution, not individual idiocies.\" Mr Houston was quoted in the Herald newspaper saying: \"I feel UKIP have over-reacted and overshot the runway.\"\\n\\nPeter Nielson, who is UKIP Scotland chairman, said he had suspended Mr Houston on Friday night. \"He will remain suspended while the matter is being investigated and then we will decide if and what further action will be taken.\" He said that any evidence would be looked into and Mr Houston may be interviewed by the party. He added: \"I can\\'t comment too much at the moment, I have one version from him but I haven\\'t seen the papers yet.\"\\n',\n",

The police had also sought to overturn a breach of human rights ruling arising from the same case. Sitting on Wednesday, three Appeal Court judges dismissed both appeals. They were challenging decisions by two judges in the High Court in February this year. It followed action by police, when three coachloads of people were searched and detained on the way to RAF Fairford and forced to return to London under police escort. The demonstrators appealed against a finding by Lord Justice May and Mr Justice Harrison that it was not unlawful for the police to turn the passengers away.\\n\\nThe police were urging Lord Chief Justice and Lord Justices Clarke and Rix to overturn the ruling that they had breached the protestors\\' human rights by detaining them in the coaches. Craig Mackey, assistant chief constable of Gloucestershire Police, said: \"We have always considered that our responses were proportionate and all our decisions on the day were based on intelligence.\" He said no one on the coaches accepted responsibility for items found on the coaches including body armour, a smoke bomb and five shields. \"Given these circumstances, and the fact that RAF Fairford, and other military installations in the UK, had been the scene of increasingly destructive disorder in the weeks preceding this incident, the police commander on the ground made the decision to turn back the coaches. \"From day one we have vigorously defended this decision, which was made out of a genuine concern that if the coaches were allowed to proceed it would have resulted in disorder and criminal damage at RAF Fairford.\" Fairford Coach Action, representing more than 80 people who appealed against the police actions, say they are prepared to take their case to the European Court of Human Rights. Their action is supported by Amnesty International and Liberty.\\n',\n",

Paying tribute, the Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer said Lord Scarman was one of the \"great advocates of our generation\".\\n\\n\"His legacy from his decisions in the Lords and the Court of Appeal is substantial. \"His work in the wake of the Brixton riots and his commitment to the vulnerable and dispossessed was second to none.\\n\\n\"A great judge, a great lawyer and a great man.\" Lord Scarman\\'s nephew George Ritchie said the peer, who passed away peacefully on Wednesday, would be \"sadly missed\".\\n\\nThe Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf, who is the most senior judge in England and Wales, said it was Lord Scarman\\'s \"pioneering work\" which paved the way for the Human Rights Act 1998. \"He was a lawyer and a judge who had a remarkable insight into human nature, and an exceptional sensitivity to the needs of a healthy society,\" he said. \"He was, personally, totally charming and he will be remembered with great affection and admiration by all who came into contact with him.\"\\n\\nDame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, the president of the Family Justice Division, said Lord Scarman was a \"good and humane judge\" and one of the greatest figures of the late 20th century. Lord Scarman will be remembered for the public inquiry he led into a string of race riots which began in Brixton when racial tensions rose after a police crackdown on street robbery. During the following three days of disturbances that spread to the Midlands, Merseyside, Bristol and Leeds, nearly 400 people were injured and buildings and vehicles were set alight.\\n\\nThe inquiry famously settled on the so-called \"rotten apples\" theory, which argued that only a few police officers were racist, saying most were not. It spawned new law enforcement practices and led to the creation of the Police Complaints Authority. Trevor Phillips, chair of the Commission for Racial Equality, praised Lord Scarman\\'s \"ability to listen\". He said: \"When Lord Scarman toured the streets of Brixton his presence was electrifying. \"A community which had been systematically ignored by everyone else was suddenly embraced by the epitome of the English establishment. \"His great quality was the ability to listen to young people of all backgrounds, many of whose language he could barely understand, genuinely to hear what they had to say and to talk to them as human beings. \"He never lost the special combination of wisdom, humanity and the spark of radicalism that marked his watershed report into the Brixton riots.\"\\n',\n",

The gains tracked a surge in US gasoline futures to a record high of $1.4850 a gallon. The jump followed a fire at Western Refining Company\\'s refinery in Texas, which shut down petrol production. A spokesman for the group was unable to say when the production unit would be back up and running. \"This market simply wants to go up,\" Citigroup Global Markets analyst Kyle Cooper told Reuters news agency.

In the approach to Spring, the market becomes much more sensitive to problems with petrol production as dealers anticipate rising demand for fuel ahead of the holiday season. The rise in prices came despite a US government report that showed domestic supplies of fuel oil and fuel were rising. Meanwhile, oil production cartel Opec\\'s recent announcement that it was now unlikely to cut production levels has also failed to calm fears on the market. Oil prices are roughly 45% higher than a year ago and have risen sharply in recent weeks due to a combination of colder weather, the declining value of the dollar and fears that Opec could rein in production to head off a seasonal drop in demand.

Vera Drake star Imelda Staunton has 5/1 odds of winning the best actress Oscar at Bet 365 and William Hill, ahead of fellow UK star Kate Winslet who has odds of 25/1 at William Hill.\\n\\nMike Leigh is the outsider in the best director category for Vera Drake, a position he holds jointly with Ray\\'s Taylor Hackford at bookmakers VC Bet. This year\\'s Academy Awards will be handed out in Hollywood on 27 February. X Factor judge Sharon Osbourne will present Sky television\\'s live coverage of the event. Meanwhile, Clive Owen\\'s best supporting actor nomination has led a bookmaker to shorten his odds of becoming the next James Bond. He has moved from 4/1 to 5/2 favourite to play 007, with Hugh Jackman and Ewan McGregor joint second favourite. \"Clive Owen\\'s nomination has sparked a betting frenzy from James Bond fans, who feel that his heightened global recognition will have done his chances of becoming the next Bond a world of good,\" said William Hill spokesman Rupert Adams.\\n',\n",
       " 'Nintendo adds media playing to DS\\n\\nNintendo is releasing an adapter for its DS handheld console so it can play music and video.\\n\\nThe add-on for the DS means people can download TV programmes, film clips or MP3 files to the adaptor and then play them back while on the move. The release of the media add-on is an attempt by the Japanese games giant to protect its dominance of the handheld gaming market. Nintendo said the media adapter will be available from February in Japan.\\n\\nThe Nintendo DS is the successor to the hugely successful GameBoy handheld game console and went on sale in Japan on 2 December. The DS has two screens, one of which is touch sensitive, and also has on-board a short-range wireless link that lets people play against each other.\\n\\nThe launch of the media adapter, and the attempt to broaden the appeal of the device, is widely seen as a response to the unveiling of the Sony PSP which was built as a multi-purpose media player and game gadget from the start. Sony is thought to be preparing pre-packaged movies and music for the PSP. The add-on will also work with the GameBoy Advance SP. Nintendo dominates the handheld gaming console world thanks to successive versions of the GameBoy. More than 28 million GameBoy Advance handhelds have been sold around the world. The dual-screen DS is also thought to be selling well with more than 2.5 million expected to be sold by the end of 2004. Nintendo said it had no plans to sell the media adapter outside Japan. When it goes on sale the adapter is expected to cost about 5000 yen (Â£25), roughly the difference in price between the DS and the higher-priced Sony PSP.\\n']"
